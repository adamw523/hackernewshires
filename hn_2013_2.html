<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>MokaFive - Redwood City, CA (between San Francisco and Palo Alto), interns (specifically college students looking for summer internships) and H1Bs welcome<p>MokaFive makes life easier for large corporate IT departments who have too many computers to manage, and life better for end-users who would otherwise have to deal with a corporate IT department that's enforcing ridiculously restrictive policies for their own sanity. Our primary product, MokaFive Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into "layers", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. There's a bunch of security stuff like full disk encryption and so forth.<p>I'm specifically looking for coworkers on my team, which works on experimental / future products. One product that's been seeing lots of growth is MokaFive BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into MokaFive Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also doing some work with MokaFive for iOS to allow you to remotely access files on your desktop from your mobile device, and doing some work with remote filesystems as an outgrowth of that.<p>We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems / virtualization, come talk to us. Our core product is in C++; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream. (If you're interested in making 2013 the year of Linux on the desktop, helping Windows shops continue to use Windows as a desktop but use Linux for drivers is an oddly great way to help bring that about -- we regularly work to improve Linux's hardware compatibility, since we have customers wanting to use a wide range of machines.)<p>See mokafive.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested!<p>I'll be in Cambridge and Pittsburgh next week for the MIT and CMU career fairs, with time to chat with interested folks in those two cities.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5151422 href="vote?for=5151422_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%31%35%30%38%33%34"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5151422></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pbiggar">pbiggar</a> 106 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5151422">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Factual is currently hiring engineers and data lovers of all levels in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, and Shanghai.
Remote work is possible for exceptional candidates who are US citizens and living in the US ('exceptional' meaning you are a great engineer and have lots of machine learning/data extraction/NLP/etc. experience that is relevant to what we do).<p>Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider that enables developers, startups, and big companies to focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.<p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure, machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop. Our LA office is our headquarters and our new Palo Alto office is still small, so new hires would have a huge impact on the culture there.<p>You can email me personally at jake@factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:<p>Palo Alto Software Engineer: <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq_#38;s=Hackernews" rel="nofollow">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq_#38;s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Software engineer: <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn_#38;s=Hackernews" rel="nofollow">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn_#38;s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Data Engineer: <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq_#38;s=Hackernews" rel="nofollow">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq_#38;s=Hackernews</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5172833 href="vote?for=5172833_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%31%35%30%38%33%34"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5172833></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=odoood">odoood</a> 102 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5172833">link</a></span></div><br>

A strong knowledge of Amazon Web Services is a must, as that's where our entire stack is deployed right now.<p>We use Puppet to manage and deploy our servers, Ruby for scripting and run a 100% Linux environment making strong use of the Unix tool chain.<p>Experience of deploying and monitoring Ruby on Rails applications: we currently extend Nginx with a Lua caching layer, to enable us to use full page-caching for the majority of our website traffic. Being comfortable debugging, maintaining and improving this layer will be essential. Knowledge of MongoDB, Redis and deploying various applications on the Java virtual machine would also be directly relevant.<p>As with all of our roles, a passion for music and/or audio is a plus!<p>--- Android developer (full-time, London)<p>We've already designed and released a successful and well-received mobile application for iOS, and now we are planning to bring the full Mixlr experience to Android devices.<p>We are looking for an experienced Android developer to join the team on a permanent basis, and design and build Mixlr's Android app - from the first Git commit onwards.<p>We're looking for somebody to hit the ground running, so were you to apply you should have prior experience in building a non-trivial Android app. You should be confident with advanced Java programming techniques including advanced multithreading techniques.<p>As with all of our positions, you'll be interacting extensively with our various web services and the wider internet, so being comfortable in the world of networking would be an advantage.<p>--- Rails developer (full-time, London)<p>Our website is still the core way in which our users interact with Mixlr, and we have big plans for it going forward.<p>The ideal candidate would have extensive Ruby on Rails experience and be comfortable working with an extensive Rspec test suite. We make heavy use of the jQuery and Backbone JavaScript frameworks, write our CSS using SCSS, and rely on MongoDB and Redis to store and cache our data.<p>We would like to meet a smart, passionate Rails developer who is eager to extend their skill set, working on a fast-growing product with thousands of daily users.<p>If you want to talk more to us, drop me a line: rob@mixlr.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5150942 href="vote?for=5150942_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%31%35%30%38%33%34"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5150942></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=fortawesome">fortawesome</a> 106 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5150942">link</a></span></div><br>

I'm a developer there currently working on infrastructure tasks and relocated over there about three years ago, and have been very happy with it.<p>We have people from all over the world relocating to work with us and are very well set up to handle relocation and visa issues, most of the people working in IT are expats so we've got a lot of experience with bringing people in.<p>It's a rapidly growing company that represents the biggest chunk of the Priceline (PCLN) group of companies where problems that look relatively mundane on paper become much more interesting due to the scale and growth levels we're operating at.<p>We use Perl for almost everything with a MySQL backend and Git for development. We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it. We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain any business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a few of our internal tools, including <a href="https://github.com/git-deploy" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/git-deploy</a> and a few CPAN modules.<p>We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers.
You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before. The sort of people we'd like to hire are good technically, excellent at communication, and can acquire a good sense of how they fit into the big picture.<p>I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume, I've posted in a similar thread here a few times before andI've fielded a bunch of questions from would-be applicants. <a href="http://booking.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">http://booking.com/jobs</a> also has some good information.<p>1.

As a result, we're cash-flow positive less than two years after our founding, and growing rapidly.<p>We have many challenging problems, including machine learning, visualization, search, and nifty user interfaces. We're looking for generalists; we'll teach you (or you'll teach yourself) what you need to know.<p>We're a fun company, with an awesome location in downtown Berkeley, foosball, game nights, and more.

Good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is a must, and a good eye for design is a nice bonus. We support only modern browsers (no IE6 headaches), so we have a very rich HTML/Javascript interface that relies on AJAX queries to pull down data and perform much of the work.<p>Software Engineer - We all wear many hats, contributing to a backend Java codebase that uses minimal XML. We use a lot of modern open source technologies: Lucene, Cassandra, AWS, etc. We have a separate Python codebase for performing offline work. We strive to write all of our code in a modular, reusable style that maximizes code-sharing and minimizes repetition. We schedule weekly time for refactoring so that we avoid the accumulation of technical debt. If you're sharp and you're interested in learning how to write performant code that uses modern academic research and operates on the latest infrastructure, you'll like this role.<p>Systems Engineer - We deal with many terabytes of data. We have our own 48-drive-bay fileserver to handle our expanding storage needs over the next couple years. We need someone with Unix experience who is comfortable in Python to help us work more efficiently. You'll manage our AWS installations, manage our internal systems, and help make our entire setup more robust.

Tidemark Systems (<a href="http://www.tidemark.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.tidemark.net</a>, note ".net") is hiring.<p>Like everybody else in the industry, we're finding hiring to be a difficult problem. For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of. But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do. So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great. But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS. You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience. If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code. This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job. This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.<p>Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound. The company is well-funded and we have people with decades of experience in the field.<p>If this position sounds interesting, my email is on my profile page.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5155385 href="vote?for=5155385_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%31%35%30%38%33%34"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5155385></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kstenerud">kstenerud</a> 105 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5155385">link</a></span></div><br>

Learndot is leading a sea change in how learning for organizations is created, comparable to the change from waterfall to agile software development.<p>We are alumni of the GrowLab accelerator in Vancouver. We sell to many happy businesses that love us (Get Satisfaction, Zirtual among them), make money and are growing very quickly.<p>Both founders are developers and we care about creating great work environments, providing flexibility and autonomy, and helping everyone continuously become better at their craft. We are currently a team of five fulltime.
Core technologies: Client-side Javascript (we use Sproutcore), Scala (all server-side code).<p>To apply email prlambert@learndot.com with [HN] in the subject line. Open positions:<p>1) App and Web Designer. We are looking for a talented visual designer who wants to help us build smart and beautiful applications for web and mobile. Time would be split around 70%/30% between design on our core app and design for our website _#38; marketing pages. You would work closely with our Chief Product Officer to create solutions for user needs, with your end product being photoshop or keynote exports for our dev team.<p>2) Front-End (JS) or Full Stack Engineer (JS + Scala). We are looking for a great javascript developer who will work directly with our CTO and Designer in building our core application across multiple devices. Learndot is a thick-client JS app using Sproutcore. Our backend API is written in Scala.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>VividCortex, Inc.<p>Charlottesville, VA (Remote, Fulltime)<p>We're building database administration tools delivered as a service. We're early-stage, pseudo-stealth, but with great momentum and access to the market, and we're well funded. It's a pretty unique company and market, and it's tackling a legitimate problem in the devops/sysadmin world. Our jobs:<p>Dev/ops: our backend systems and infrastructure are all written in Go (it’s awesome). We are ramping up to handle a jaw-dropping amount of incoming data. Data storage involves MySQL and other storage technologies in a fault-tolerant, distributed environment. We're looking for someone who can switch in and out of a couple of developer and sysops roles -- writing some server software, setting up some machines, whipping up some Chef recipes, and so on. We're a small team, so the real job description is "we need another backend/infrastructure engineer."<p>Frontend: the web app is backed by PHP and Symfony2, and fronted by a lot of JavaScript, using up-to-date technologies and frameworks. There's a lot of API interaction from JavaScript, and a complex user interface that's key for making our customers rave about the experience, not just the technology. We'd love to find someone who can hop back and forth between the PHP and the stuff that runs in the browser, and it's even better if they've got some design sensibilities and can help shape the product's features and functionality too. If you've got the latter skillset, then the PHP coding is optional.<p>Head of UX/UI: your impact would be immediate as we already have leading consumer web companies using our technology. Your impact would also be lasting because there really isn’t anything in this space, and, if you can lead the defining efforts of UX/UI for system administration, then you will have moved the industry forward. 
Ideally, you know Photoshop, have worked with front-end development teams and know a little bit about system administration. Additionally, we work with a lot of charts and graphs, and notification feeds. Other than that, we are open to a variety of experiences.<p>As an early-stage company, we offer the chance to end up owning a fair chunk of what we believe is likely to be a very valuable business.<p>Email jobs@vividcortex.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5153051 href="vote?for=5153051_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%31%35%30%38%33%34"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5153051></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jacoblyles">jacoblyles</a> 106 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5153051">link</a></span></div><br>

Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalising specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts. Brands include fashion, beauty, homeware, and lifestyle categories, many familiar from the high street. The company has about 80 employees and a substantial annual turnover.

    Full Time or Contract. Remote OK, Local Preferred.

We are a 1.5 yr old startup working to disrupt the $60 billion waste industry, and we are primarily looking for a backend _#38; systems developer. We need individuals who are willing to solve problems inherent to an aging industry, and by doing so, topple the biggest players in the market.<p><pre><code>    About the company: 
</code></pre>
Sequoia is saving businesses money by incentivizing them to recycle. We work with almost any sized business to make recycling and waste-vendor management simple.<p>We have hundreds of client locations in a dozen states, and are cash flow positive with reoccurring monthly revenue, but need to stay on top of our tech development to stay ahead of the multi-billion dollar players in the space.<p>You will be an integral part of a small development team, tasked with improving upon 1-2 years of database, iOS, and customer portal/CRM development.<p>Currently we are rebuilding our backend, taking into consideration all the lessons of our first year and a half with clients. After doing so, we'll be prepared to roll out service in nearly every metro-area around the country - scaling on what will be your product!<p><pre><code>    _#60;-- Requirements/Responsibilties --_#62;
</code></pre>
Leadership experience, with the ability to produce from conception to execution.
Comfortable architecting 'behind the scenes' systems, and building those systems in a manner suitable for scale.
A keen eye for customer UX.<p>Preferably, you have a cool project, website, or demo that you could send in.<p>We've done a majority of development for iOS, and run our data services on Salesforce and an AWS RDS instance. We're looking to get away from Salesforce as the backend to our customer portal and develop our own, pulling data from our own database.<p><pre><code>    _#60;-- What we will be working on --_#62;
</code></pre>
Collecting more data streams, via government agencies and any available API's, so that we may better analyze our customer's services.
Further down the road, we will make trash receptacles 'smart' for data collection and customer service.<p><pre><code>    _#60;-- To apply --_#62;

Fitocracy is a social network that empowers everyone to reach their next level of fitness. Nearly  a million people use our web and mobile apps to track their progress, compete against their friends, and get real world results. We are building a world where fitness is possible for everyone. Enough of the useless crap that's polluting the market these days. We're setting out to change everything.
We are an 8 person team based out of NYC that recently raised money from a variety of VCs and angels, including 500 Startups, Eniac Ventures, folks from Zynga/Google/Greylock. The founders, having gone through significant fitness transformations in their own personal lives, originally started Fitocracy in late 2010 as a way to marry their love of fitness with their years growing up playing classic role playing games like Final Fantasy and Everquest.<p>Contact

Our goal is ambitious - we're building the next generation communication voice service at the intersection between PTT, phone calls, SMS, conference calls, and multimedia messaging.<p>It's no small feat to achieve, to keep one of the world's fastest growing voice applications humming along and growing at a phenomenal pace.

The problems we're facing are at a scale only seen at companies like Twitter and Facebook and we're looking for exceptional people who can help us tackle them.<p>We closed our first outside round of funding last spring, and our brand new offices are right off Market Street in San Francisco. There's tons of restaurants and shopping nearby at Westfield and Union Square to spend your hard earned cash on, and if you're a musician there's a few outside on the street that we wouldn't mind you teaching a few new songs to.

But GIGTANK is the only one on a living fiber network. We are looking for innovators interested in applications, devices and platforms that can leverage massive amounts of connectivity. We’ll also put you in front of decision makers from companies like Alcatel Lucent, Cisco, IBM, and many more! You’ll be one of the few teams in the world with access to a $300,000,000 fiber optic grid and potential customers already using it.<p>Who is an ideal candidate for the GIGTANK?<p>Developers, engineers, hackers, designers, and dreamers. We’re looking for people who have big ideas and the skills to help build them. The more experience you have and the more projects you’ve worked on the better.  Remember that we want at least two team members for startups. If you don’t have a team, see below info about applying as a specialist.<p>Entrepreneur Application:

Employees here are treated incredibly well and have a lot of freedom to get the job done, or to create something new and useful. We hire smart people and then trust them to get things done, which means refreshingly little babysitting occurs. The work environment is friendly, informal and intellectual.<p>What we're looking for:<p>- knowledgeable C++ devs who are comfortable with algorithms and search<p>- Android and iOS developers<p>- Windows and C# developers<p>- familiarity with Oracle DB software and SUN hardware is a plus<p>Our company is profitable via a long-standing contract with the USAF, and exploratory with various startup side projects. Right now we are working on connecting drivers and vehicles to live traffic light data for routing and other novel applications. We tend to hire really smart people from various backgrounds, and this method has served us pretty well.<p>We do cool stuff!
