<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Hanover, Germany. Work Permit/Blue Card and Relocation Assistance Provided.<p>Looking for strong Perl developers for a company in Hanover, Germany. They're stable, profitable and they've been in business for years. Hanover is a beautiful, bike-friendly, mid-sized town in the north of Germany. The cost of living is low and the quality of life is high. It's a green-friendly town and hosts one of the largest Oktoberfests in the world. While we're listing "desired" skills, keep in mind that the company is happy to be flexible on most of this so long as you can convince them that you can help improve their systems:<p><pre><code>    - You have a strong Perl, testing, and refactoring background. 
      You'll be helping them transform legacy systems into modern ones.
    - You have experience with AJAX, SOAP, REST and other Web technologies.
    - You have good relational database experience, preferably
      MySQL (what a surprise!)
    - You understand that Object Oriented code is more than just using
      Moose or blessing a reference.
    - Familiarity with Linux
    - You speak English. German's a plus, but not mandatory.
    - You don't drool on your t-shirt.
</code></pre>
In return:<p><pre><code>    - A competitive salary and strong job security (always profitable,
      very low employee turnover)
    - Top-notch equipment
    - Shared offices to two or three devs -- no open plan
    - Offices in downtown
    - Flexible and fair working hours
    - 30 days vacation!
    - Get sent to conferences (if you want)
</code></pre>
Why Hanover?<p><pre><code>    - An active local Perl Mongers group.
    - Lots of asparagus!
    - 500k people
    - University town
    - Greenest city in Germany (forest, lake, parks, rivers)
    - Great transportation
    - Low rent and low cost of living!
</code></pre>
Your job will not just be to hack Perl. You'll be actively working to help modernize their systems and improve standards. You'll have a high level of responsibility. In return, you get to enjoy a friendly, beautiful city and culture. Take a two week road trip across Europe and still have a month's vacation when you get back to work.<p>Send email to jobs at allaroundtheworld dot fr.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5805249" href="vote?for=5805249_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%38%30%33%37%36%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5805249"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bayesianhorse">bayesianhorse</a> 416 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5805249">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Thanks for the kind words :)<p>For the Blue Card, you can change employers as much as you want because it's attached to the employee rather than the employer. Further, depending on the country, after two or three years, you can then <i>legally</i> take work in any other EEA country (except the UK, Ireland and Denmark, all of whom opted out of the Blue Card program). There are some technicalities involved, but those are the basics.<p>Germany's program is particularly great because you can get a permanent residency permit after only two years if you learn German (to a B2 level, I think), or after three years if you don't speak German. In other words, it's a permanent entry into the EU. I'm an American living in France and I'm married to a French woman, so I don't have to worry, but otherwise, I'd apply for the Blue Card in a heartbeat!</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5805595" href="vote?for=5805595_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%38%30%33%37%36%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5805595"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zerr">zerr</a> 416 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5805595">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">It's not for freelancers, no. You can go to Germany and stay up there for up to six months while looking for work, but to get a Blue Card, you have to have a contract with an annual salary attached to it. Your Blue Card is good for the length of the contract plus three months. However, as mentioned, if you stay long enough, you can apply for permanent German residency.<p>Keep in mind that the German government has been tweaking the Blue Card law, so you probably want to reverify what I've said if you go that route. That being said, I just received a PM on Reddit from someone who moved to Germany after seeing a post I made about the Blue Card and they just got a job offer. They're going to sign and apply for their Blue Card with that contract.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="200"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5811754" href="vote?for=5811754_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%38%30%33%37%36%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5811754"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=0m">0m</a> 414 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5811754">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The Netherlands has a very attractive 30% tax reduction for knowledge migrants which makes it attractive for foreign talent to come to the country.<p>It seems to almost be a common denominator that when Dutch companies stop valuing their employees (treat them badly, seeing them as expenses, etc.) they start abusing this tax reduction to recruit cheap foreign labour; often after they've burned their bridges in the small and tightly-knit local tech community.<p>So ... If you're a foreigner and are considering moving to the Netherlands, be careful with companies where the majority of employees is not native, since there's a good change you won't get to experience the respectful work culture Dutch companies are generally famous for.<p>If you're already used to a culture with a greater power-distance (e.g. Russia, US, India) it might still not be all that bad for you though and either way it's pretty easy to find good jobs elsewhere once you're in the country.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5804132" href="vote?for=5804132_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%38%30%33%37%36%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5804132"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=brian_foy">brian_foy</a> 416 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5804132">link</a></span></div><br>

My wife and I are starting a company trying to help people live their dream of living in other countries and that's a very hard thing to do. You (if you're really brian) know that I write <a href="http://www.overseas-exile.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.overseas-exile.com/</a> and I've been writing that for <i>years</i> trying to help people move abroad because I love being an expat. We created this company because now we have a chance to really help people do what I'm so passionate about, but when someone tears down our work it also threatens to take away another chance for people to experience life abroad. The fact that we're doing this with IT companies is almost incidental: it's our background and it's what we know best.<p>What we <i>don't</i> do is throw CVs at a company without telling the candidate what the location and the company are like because it's important for the candidate to decide for themselves, rather than simply rely on rumors. We get to know the companies we work with so we can make sure that the candidate is happy with the company and the company is happy with the candidate. Everyone we've helped move abroad has thanked us and I don't believe anyone has any illusions that we're promising them a gold-plated Ferrari and a personal masseuse.<p>Regarding your comments about Booking.com and my reasons for leaving, people have asked and I publicly stated my reasons at <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2011/12/moving-to-paris.html" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2011/12/moving-to-paris.htm...</a>. However, I was very cagey about that because much of the reason was intensely personal and nobody's darned business, but since you're attacking me by saying it's a "sad" thing I'm doing, I'll say it now: my wife had just had a baby, was very tired, and wanted to move back to her home country. I love my wife very dearly and I would do anything to help her. So off to France we went. Making a decision to move to another country is very hard and there are always many factors that come into play, but that was the primary reason and I've already told a few people about it privately, but I didn't shout it from the rooftops because it's nobody's business that my wife was tired and wanted to go home. Did I gripe about other issues from time to time? Sure, everyone does. But my primary motivation was my wife and daughter and it worked: my wife is very happy.<p>There are still plenty of well-known senior Perl developers who are at Booking.com: Yves, Rafael, Ævar, and many others who are known by first name to much of the community. Booking.com isn't a good fit for everyone, and not everyone is good fit for Booking.com -- that describes every business on the planet.<p>I also see that you linked to that "truth about Booking.com" post. I've never publicly commented on that simply because people have strong feelings about that company and just like vi versus emacs, I saw no point in wading into the debate.<p>So I'll say this about that post: that was clearly an anonymous disgruntled employee and that should be a warning sign to anyone who read it. Whoever they are, they've never been willing to stand up and take responsibility for their words, though if they're still working there, I could understand why. Their post was a mixture of truths, half-truths, and outright falsehoods. Plus, I felt there was a lot of lying by omission. Note how many Booking employees responded (all but one of whom I know personally). They were honest about the company and generally positive about it. Some people don't understand why so many extremely talented Perl developers are happy to work there, but that alone should give people pause.<p>By now most people probably know that Booking.com isn't a "modern Perl" shop, but they're not "treating their employees like dogs". They're <i>extremely</i> business-oriented and while I don't always agree with their decisions, the fact that they've managed to become one of the largest internet properties on the planet says something about what they're doing right. And if you work for them and do well, you'll get plenty of advancement opportunities if you want it. And I also know plenty of programmers working for them who have earned fantastic bonuses by producing great results. They pay a fair salary for Amsterdam, bonuses, and if you qualify for the Dutch 30% ruling, you get an extra several hundred euros a month.<p><i>TL;DR</i>: They're not for everyone, but the rumor mill is just that: a rumor factory.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="200"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5806067" href="vote?for=5806067_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%38%30%33%37%36%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5806067"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=papaver">papaver</a> 416 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5806067">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">My takeaway from this is that stay as far away as possible from Booking.com.<p>You might certainly say they are not a good fit for everyone, but I think when someone in HN community is looking for a job change, I am sure they are also looking at the other "intangible"/not-so-obvious aspects. Like: does the company treat every employee respectfully? Do they provide the right environment where even the underdog can excel? They can be business minded, but do they understand their core cannot be culturally immoral?<p>On all counts Booking has fell short to me (just from your justification).<p>Sad but true.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="200"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5809758" href="vote?for=5809758_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%38%30%33%37%36%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5809758"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mtrimpe">mtrimpe</a> 415 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5809758">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">For those without showdead on; it seems that Brian (not-D) Foy was hellbanned for his comments.<p>It seems obvious that he is a disgruntled ex-employee so you should take his statements with a grain of salt, but since I don't see any reason for hellbanning him for that (maybe he got too many flags?,) so I'm reposting them there.<p>------------<p>I am not Brian D Foy so stop maligning his name. Brian D Foy doesn't work for Booking and he never has.<p>Booking tries to keep the big names you mentioned happy so that they don't spill the beans. These names get the best development projects and the big money. One of their job responsibilities as a senior developer is to advertise and say good things about the company. I concur with you that they play this game well. In fact open praise in developer forums about the company is a sure way to land good bonus.<p>They make tonnes of money but none of that is shared with the developers although they put up with the grunge work of fixing one of the worst Perl code in the industry patched up by people who left in a hurry.<p>I speak for those who are going to leave their family, friends at home with the hopes that they would be doing good work based on the big names working there only to find that the reality is totally different.<p>The treatment meted out to the rest of the developers is shameful and you know it and the Perl blog mentions all the pain points.<p>The expats do not know the local employment laws of Netherlands and Booking.com fully exploits this to the hilt.<p>And the truth can be found out easily from people who left the company and who currently do not get a direct/indirect monetary benefit of saying good things about the company, and given that you are recruiting for them and get approximately thousand Euro atleast for every successful lead, it disqualifies you.<p>------------<p>The Netherlands has employee friendly policies. After three years in a company, employees automatically get an "indefinite" contract. An "indefinite" contract ensures that the employer cannot kick out the employee on a whim unlike in the US.<p>Good Dutch companies give out indefinite contract to the expats at the beginning of their employment itself but not Booking.com.<p>Booking.com gives out a 1 year contract to start with and after every 2 years kicks out its developers and gets new ones. So the frequent hiring you see is one of the side-effects of this cheap policy. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the big names Curtis "Ovid" Poe mentioned jumps on this mailing list to say - "not me", but the truth is this is their cheap game.<p>So after two years the delta of ones career capital can be summed up as:<p>1. experience in copy pasting code and cargo culting which would translate to nothing when you try out for another job.<p>2. no monetary benefit. Booking has the most underpaid developers in the industry. Those bonuses they promise never come. Given how expensive Amsterdam is, one wouldn't have saved up a penny after two years and if you have a family you might end up in debt.<p>In short one is ruining his/her best two years without any increase in career capital or monetary standing.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5805824" href="vote?for=5805824_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%38%30%33%37%36%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5805824"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Ovid">Ovid</a> 416 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5805824">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">San Francisco, CA. Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day. We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href="http://academia.edu/hiring" rel="nofollow">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission here <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/</a> (The Future of Peer Review) and here <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/</a> (The Future of Science)<p>We want to hire world class engineers.

Our product is built on Rails, and helps businesses save money, and all of their people who do purchasing and expenses to have much more efficient and enjoyable jobs.

Your workload in a given month might include bugs, a feature or two to build by yourself or with a few others, improving our technology stack, or implementing your own ideas to improve the product.  We like people who are full stack, and like learning about all areas of the product.<p>I am a full-stack dev, so I do everything from tuning database queries to Rails to JavaScript to visual design on my features, its pretty damn rewarding and interesting.<p>Working on the product development team is pretty great.  I enjoy working and spending time with everyone on the team, and we have smart people from lots of different backgrounds and locations.  We have a neat office space in downtown San Mateo that is open and perfect for a team of programmers (we keep the noise down when we're working).  We are two blocks from the San Mateo CalTrain station, we have plenty of room for bikes, and free parking passes if you want to drive.<p>We have had remote developers for a long time, across the country and world.  We also allow for working from home as needed for local people (or wherever else you are productive), and tend to <i>strongly encourage</i> people to go home and rest if they look tired or don't feel well.<p>We offer good pay, great health / dental / vision insurance, unlimited vacation, extremely flexible hours (pretty much be in by 11am if you are local).  We have "field trip" lunches on Wednesdays to get the team together and relax, and other days we might walk to the park or somewhere downtown for lunch.<p>Please email a quick intro and your resume, website, or github to <i></i>* brianfarr@gmail.com <i></i>*  if you are interested or have any questions.<p>If you seem like a good possibility, your resume <i>will</i> be seen by my manager and the team this Monday.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Front-End Developer - Philadelphia, PA - 50onRed - Relocation Assistance Provided<p>For anyone that sees this, I also work at 50onRed as the Director of Product and am hiring someone for my team.<p>As Wellington said, 50onRed operates an ad network that serves billions of requests per day. To support those operations we also build dashboard and campaign management interfaces that are used by 1,000's of advertisers.<p>One unique thing we have to offer at 50onRed is that the product team is given a lot of freedom to drive the product based on customer needs, feedback, and data we collect on usage and engagement. And it's not just lip service! So, with that being said, the product team houses product managers, community managers, UX engineers, and now we are looking for a front-end developer.<p>Why is it cool to be on the product team? If you have a strong opinion on something the product should do, you no longer need to worry about your boss in engineering telling you no because it's a PITA due to some backend reasons. Now, the product team will have your back and work on getting any changes implemented to get what you need done.<p>What will the front-end developer do? You will be an EXPERT in javascript, html, and css. And not building simple jQuery toggles or copy pasting some code from stackoverflow. Our dashboards are moving quickly towards being more "AJAX-y". To help with the amount of JS, we are creating re-usable javascript widgets that can be used across different parts of the app. You should understand the implications of different JS decisions on browser performance, flexibility of how the widget can be used in different scenarious, etc. You can take a mockup from our UX Engineer (that was created after discussions with you, of course) and code it up with ease.<p>Why 50? Because you want to make decisions that impact 1,000's of customers in your first week. We push code frequently and test how it's used by our customers. We get feedback from our customers instantly. You want to take ownership and drive a product to be better. Do you think we should be a one page web app and use Angular? Great, sell us on it and let's do it. You think Prototype is 100x better than jQuery? Ok, then sell us on that instead. (Might be hard!) But... the point is that we are open to using any technology that is right for the job as long as it is the right business decision. No emotional attachments to code.<p>Email frank@50onred.com, I'd love to talk to you if you think you'd be a good fit.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5811549" href="vote?for=5811549_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%38%30%33%37%36%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5811549"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=orangethirty">orangethirty</a> 414 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5811549">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I worked on a project (probably one of your competitors) that was an ad network.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Kaiserslautern, Germany.  REMOTE<p>My name is Sebastian, I am the CTO at Aircloak.<p>Aircloak is a young and well-funded startup working on privacy preserving data-processing and analytics. 
We are a spin-out from the German Max-Planck Institute for Software System research institute, where we also currently have our offices.<p>Our technology allows us to process highly private streams of data and only ever make fully anonymous data available to our customers. One of the features that makes our system unique is that no-one, including operators, customers, and ourselves, ever has access to the sensitive raw data. This property holds true even after we update the software running on the machines processing the sensitive data!<p>You should:<p><pre><code>  - be intelligent
  - have a good sense of humour
  - be an amazing programmer
  - wish to change the world
</code></pre>
Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.<p>We are:<p><pre><code>  - recent University of Cambridge graduates
  - + one director at the Max-Planck Institute
</code></pre>
The work environment is highly international and diverse, and we would like to keep it that way.<p>We are looking to hire two more full time engineers. We offer good and stable salary, generous equity and great facilities.<p>Feel free to email me if you have any questions!
My email address is sebastian@aircloak.com.<p>I hope to hear from you!<p>You can find more on our website:

Does years of experience determine who the best engineers are? How about a whiteboarding session with people peppering you with questions - is that how you normally work?<p>We may only be a simple startup, but we have this crazy idea that your past work, production code and open source contributions are the best indicators of your ability. If these are high quality, let’s talk.<p>Who we are:<p>A small group (under 10) that has built two consumer facing products. We’re technology agnostic and believe the best developers can teach themselves what they need to learn. There are no politics, no prima donnas and we just like getting things done.<p>Edviso is a consultation marketplace for experts to give advice via live video chat.
Catincan is a crowdfunding platform for open source projects.<p>What we need:<p>Software Engineer that solves problems. You’re someone that figures things out, cares about code quality and understands the choices you make can lead to technical debt. You like learning new languages and have your own method that’s worked for you time and again to get spun up on something quickly. Ideally you’ll know some of these technologies:<p>Scala, Haskell, Prolog, Lisp, Eiffel, Erlang, Go, Meteor, Coffeescript, Ember.js, AngularJS<p>We don’t just need another engineer, we need another team member.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Onespacemedia - Cambridge, UK. <a href="http://www.onespacemedia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onespacemedia.com/</a><p>---<p>Junior/middle-weight web developer<p>Are you an internet-obsessed design-savvy coder? Interested in being part of a friendly, dynamic team in a central Cambridge studio? We want to talk to front or back end developers who are creative, organised and love all things web. Ideally you'll have some or all of the following skills:<p>Knowledge of writing standards-compliant, high-performing HTML5 and CSS web pages. 
Experience of working with popular web libraries. We use Django and jQuery, but you can learn these on the job. 
Good knowledge of at least one programming language. 
We work primarily in Python and Javascript, but are happy for you to learn these on the job too. 
An understanding of database programming and design. 
Familiarity with *nix based operating systems. 
Awareness of popular web APIs, such as Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook. 
More important than relevant experience is the drive to learn and expand your skill set. If you've got a commitment to excellence and can demonstrate an aptitude for programming then we want to hear from you. In return you'll receive a competitive salary, full training and your own top of the range laptop (we work predominantly on Macs but we can let the odd Windows machine slip through the net!).<p>_#62; What you can expect to work on<p>Expect to work on a wide range of challenging projects. We don't have a cookie cutter approach to the web and push the design and technical envelope on all our work. Recent projects have included: an application that manages, filters and analyses radio spectrum data from a series of nationally-located nodes; a responsive website for a high-end safari and Africa travel company; a large website and online admin system to manage the ever-changing attractions and events for an interactive science centre; and a website/application that tracks, maps and graphs the progress of University spin-out companies. Most of our projects are responsive and we're as committed to the front-end user experience as we are to what's happening under the hood.<p>_#62; How we work<p>As a team we listen, learn, plan, design, build, test and deliver together. Whilst different people are responsible for their own part of a project, we all understand the importance of the chain and support each other to get things done. You'll be expected to manage your own workload and you won't ever have a project manager breathing down your neck. Our process is front-loaded with in-depth research and discovery rounds in which both developers and designers participate. This keeps scope creep to a minimum and deadlines and budgets realistic. We don't subscribe to unnecessary bureacracy and keep things streamlined and agile. You'll get to talk to clients too - we all share the successes and the challenges of a project together.<p>_#62; Learning<p>The web is constantly evolving so we expect you to as well. Experimentation and learning new skills is part of the fabric at Onespacemedia. Need some books or course materials? No problem. Want to try out some new techniques on a test project? No problem. Something you want to tell the world about a technology or trend? Blog about it on the website. We expect our team members to be passionate and knowledgeable about their field of expertise.<p>_#62; Lifestyle<p>Working at Onespacemedia is fun. We do serious work for serious clients but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it. Expect plenty of laughter, music, company lunches, trips to the pub and impromptu ping pong battles. Just ten minutes walk from the station and ten minutes walk from the centre of Cambridge, the office is located just of Mill Road, the cultural heart of Cambridge (and probably the closest thing you can get to a London street outside of the capital). We're surrounded by green spaces, pubs, shops and cafés (including the legendary Hot Numbers). We've even got parking spaces. We operate a flexitime scheme too so those of you who are commuting from out of town don't have to spend four hours a day stuck in a traffic jam to and from work.<p>_#62; How to apply<p>Please send CV, covering note and links to any websites or applications you have created, or been involved with, to jobs@onespacemedia.com. We are open to enquiries from individuals seeking part-time and full-time work.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5804302" href="vote?for=5804302_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%38%30%33%37%36%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5804302"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Adrock">Adrock</a> 416 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5804302">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Ringio - Full Time, Near Courthouse Metro, VA / Washington, DC<p>keywords: go, growing pains, grails, node.js, ejabberd, erlang, realtime<p>Ringio(<a href="http://ringio.com" rel="nofollow">http://ringio.com</a>) provides internet phone service to small businesses to improve the quality of their phone interactions. We have some great ideas for owning this domain and are looking for a few great software engineers to help take our product to the next level. If you're interested (or know someone who is), read more and email srijak AT ringio.com[1]. If you are interested in Go or node.js you should definitely get in touch.<p>Major areas of development focus:<p><pre><code>  - Scaling: We are growing at a rate where our current stack and architecture need
              to be rethought. So, there is a lot of interesting work to be done.

  - Modern HTML Applications: We’re very excited about  JavaScript frameworks that
              have grown in popularity (like Angular.js, D3). We’re interested in
              using web technologies for our mobile and desktop applications, so if
              you’re experienced with (or just interested in) JavaScript, 
              CoffeeScript, SCSS, WebSockets, or BOSH, there’s a lot of research 
              and development to be done.

  - Voice Technology: All calls using Ringio run through our voice systems to enable
              things like on-hold music, call screening, and transfers.
              We have a lot of new voice functionality that we’d like to build,
              as well as technology we’d like to integrate. This is fairly unique to
              our industry and involves some interesting timing, reliability,
              concurrency, and state management problems.

  - API Development: Integration with CRM systems and reselling partners requires APIs
              for large pieces of our platform. We need help expanding our APIs, 
              making sure they’re usable and secure, and testing that they’re working
              correctly.
</code></pre>
We’re Looking For People Who Are:<p><pre><code>  - Smart software developers

  - Familiar with object oriented programming. We use Grails and Java for our major
    systems but are moving towards Go, Node.js for our service layer. We don't require
    you know any of these languages, but expertise in *a* language is desired.
    If you are interested in Go or node.js you should definitely get in touch.

  - Familiar with Unix/Linux command-line systems. Logging into a Linux server to count
    the number of ERROR lines in a log file grouped by hour wouldn’t be difficult
    for you.

  - Excited about joining a startup and wearing many hats.

  - Authorized to work in the US

  - Able to work from our Courthouse Metro office (flexibility to work from home
    sometimes, but most time will be at the office)
</code></pre>

It got us noticed and got us some funding, so now the chips are down and we have to prove we can do it again!<p>Our biggest need in the short term is a UX designer with strong graphic design skills to help us shape the look and feel of CodeRunner:2. You will have an amazing amount of influence over the visual style and user experience. We really need someone who can take a project from vision to reality in a short amount of time, and who has a proven track record of working closely with a team in a highly collaborative environment. In the early stages we will need someone who can be on site most of the time. This role will start as a contract with the potential to work into a full-time position. You can find the original job posting here:<p><a href="http://www.rocketchicken.com/2013/05/23/mobile-game-ui-designer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rocketchicken.com/2013/05/23/mobile-game-ui-desig...</a><p>In the more medium term, we need to find a server engineer who has a lot of experience with web services and scalable database systems. Ideally you'll be well-versed in both SQL and NoSQL solutions and can help us assess our requirements to identify the best solution. This game is going to rely heavily on a pretty sophisticated server back-end, so you'll be right in the middle of building what we think is going to be the coolest mobile game ever. ;) This is a full-time position:<p><a href="http://www.rocketchicken.com/2013/04/02/experienced-server-engineer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rocketchicken.com/2013/04/02/experienced-server-e...</a><p>And if you're not interested in these positions, but want to see what CodeRunner is all about, check out the web site here:<p><a href="http://www.coderunnergame.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.coderunnergame.com</a><p>Thanks!<p>Ryan</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5804199" href="vote?for=5804199_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%38%30%33%37%36%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5804199"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jesshayden">jesshayden</a> 416 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5804199">link</a></span></div><br>

Software Developer Intern 
*Accepting Applications for Summer 2013
(Not interested in coding? There are tons of ways to get involved! Email us: info@learningequality.org and we'll be in touch!)<p>Where?
UC San Diego, La Jolla, California. Remote is fine too!<p>When?
July 1 - September 15, 2013 (flexible)<p>Who are we?
The Foundation for Learning Equality (FLE) is a non-profit organization dedicated to creating tools for sharing and creating open-licensed educational content for use by anyone around the world, with a focus on reaching those with limited or no internet access.<p>We are a group of hackers, educators, and aspiring ninjas, that are excited about bridging the divide between those with access to high-quality educational resources, and those without.<p>What you get to hack on:
KA Lite (kalite.learningequality.org) is a lightweight web app for serving core Khan Academy content (videos and exercises) without needing internet connectivity, from a local server (even a Raspberry Pi!). Take it for a test drive, it’s open-source. Check out our wiki for more information.<p>Technologies we use and skills we would value (but learning on the job is acceptable!):
Python!
Django
JavaScript / HTML5 apps
jQuery
Backbone.js
Video.js
HTML / CSS / LESS
Android development
Hardware / networking / system administration
Cryptography / databases / API design<p>What we plan on building:<p>This summer, we will be continuing to develop the KA Lite project, to meet the needs of the schools and organizations that are deploying the project around the world, and make it accessible to even more people. Some of the features we’ll be working on are:
Including mechanisms for peer-to-peer synchronization of software updates, content, and usage data, so that it can be kept up to date even in no-bandwidth scenarios.
Improving the coach reporting tools and adding more gamification.
Polishing up an in-progress Android wrapper for KA Lite, so it can be used completely standalone on mobile devices.
Adding support for internationalized interfaces and content (dubbed videos and translated exercises).
Adding the features that you, the interns, dream up! Bring your ideas to help increase educational access, and improve the user experience for both students and teachers.<p>We will also be beginning development on a new platform for distributing and hosting other open-licensed educational materials (beyond Khan Academy), as well as allowing teachers to author their own content -- offline -- to use in their classrooms as well as share back with the rest of the world. There will be exciting opportunities to be part of the design and prototyping phases of this new initiative over the summer!<p>We Offer the Following Benefits:<p>- You will be hacking on a piece of technology that has the potential to bring high-quality educational resources to literally billions of people who have never before had access.
- You’ll be surrounded by a wide variety of development talent, from FLE team members, to professionals on the UC San Diego campus, and our internationally based partners. 
- You’ll have the chance to make real contributions to an ambitious development road map at a fast-growing startup nonprofit.
- The UC San Diego campus is beautiful, the weather is perfect, and it’s only a five-minute walk to one of the world’s most iconic beaches. 
- A recommendation to our many partners in the tech and education industry.<p>Expectations
- We believe that you’ll get as much out of this as you put in. If you want, you can work 20 hours per week, or you can work 40 (although we do ask for at least 20).
- Set realistic goals for yourself and hold yourself accountable for reaching them.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Improbable worlds is a privately funded London based start up working on a transformative new underlying technology for online games.<p>The team here is made up of some incredible young computer scientists from the best academic institutions, hedge funds and software houses in the country. We work primarily in Scala and C# on challenging greenfield problems in areas as distinct as distributed systems and procedural generation. The underlying technology is extremely exciting and the hope is that we can do certain things previously considered completely impossible in online experiences. We are also in talks with  AAA games talent from well known titles, with the intention of building  a game on top of our tech.<p>As a working environment we offer a few golden principles that you might find very refreshing:<p>Logic and careful thinking always trump seniority. Code quality matters just as much as productivity and much of the work here is challenging stuff nobody else has done before. 
Despite working on core tech, we get to build fun things! Working games and prototypes that stretch our platform and give core developers a chance to work with their own APIS. You even get to build cool stuff  in the interview :) ( Past candidates have created working train systems, pokemon clones, physical simulations….)<p>We are still somewhat in stealth mode but are happy to provide more details during the process. If you are not uncomfortable with an exceptionally challenging interview process, keen to work on hard problems in a flat, peer led team, then please email Recruitment@improbableworlds.net.<p>Also we are currently based in a mansion with a pool…. Happy to relocate good candidates from overseas.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr style="height:10px"></tr><tr><td class="title"><a href="/x?fnid=F6M5XfUL3WJzPp7ATcuZWU" rel="nofollow">More</a></td></tr></table><br><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Chicago, IL. Full-time. On-site preferred, but remote possible. Relocation assistance provided.<p>Our development team is building web applications for streamlining digital media planning. Our customers live in our apps eight hours a day, negotiating complex deals at blazing speed. We’re looking for someone with experience developing fast, modular web applications in a collaborative team environment to be the newest member of our growing band of talented developers, product managers and designers.<p>Consistently ranked among the best places to work by Crain's Chicago, we're proud to have rapidly built a leading reputation in Chicago's software space.  We're looking for exceptional Ruby _#38; JS developers...<p>You’re right for this job if:<p>- You're great at developing advanced web applications using Ruby, Rails, JavaScript (modern MVC/MVP frameworks like Backbone, Ember, Angular a plus) and HTML/CSS 
- You get relational databases, and also know a thing or two about document stores (and would like to learn more)
- You work to build and maintain software with the highest standards of software craftsmanship
- You believe in agile methodologies, including TDD, pairing, CI, and collective code ownership
- You want to help build a culture of learning and continuous improvement on the team
- You want to build strong business domain knowledge related to online advertising, campaign planning and execution, ad serving technologies and related topics
- You enjoy collaborating with customers, product owners, developers and testers to solve real business problems
- You can collaborate with Product Managers to create acceptance and integration tests
- You can help support and improve development infrastructure including our continuous integration server and automated testing infrastructure<p>A few reasons people love to work here:<p>- 20% Time: Lots of shops talk about it, but we actually walk the walk. Every Friday you'll come in and work on whatever you want to. We've got people working on getting traffic lights hooked up to our CI, and factory alarm bells to announce the registration of new clients. Want to learn something about mobile development? We've got people working on iOS and Android apps.  Want to learn a new language? Maybe you'll want to pair with someone working on a DART application. Almost anything goes, and we all skip our normal stand-ups to have a quick chat about our fun projects.<p>- Work/Life Balance: We want you to love your job, and we know that's only possible if you have some time to step away from it. No death marches. Lots of vacation time. A super flexible schedule. All we ask in return for it is for you to do awesome things while you're here.<p>- Excellent People: We hire nice, smart people, who are awesome at what they do.  We go out to lunch, play games, have drinks, and hang out together.  You're a part of the team on day one.<p>Fun: Foosball room (yes, it's a high-end Tornado table), beer tap, soda fountain, free snacks and drinks.  Intelligentsia whole-bean coffee, burr grinder, aeropress, super-automatic espresso machine.  Weekly yoga classes.  Play some RBI Baseball or Mario Kart on the Wii.  Quoridor matches at lunch time (you've never heard of it, but you will learn to love it).<p>Training and Conferences: We're a Platinum sponsor of Windy City Rails.  Think there's another conference we should sponsor?  We're up for it.  Which conference do you prefer, RailsConf or RubyConf?  Want to go learn about data visualization from Tufte?  Maybe you'd like to take some classes towards a Master's Degree?  We'll help you out with all of it.<p>Hardware: Top of the line MacBook Pro.  24' displays.  Whatever accessories you want.  No desk phones.  Need something else to help you get your job done?  Let us know, we'll do our best to hook you up.<p>Autonomy: We only hire adults, so we treat everyone like an adult.  You know the best ways to get your job done, so we leave it up to you.  It sounds obvious, but you probably know it isn't always true.  At Centro, it is.<p>Compensation: We offer competitive salaries, bonuses, and a stock option program. Plus, 401(k) matching, great health care, gym memberships and lots of other little stuff.<p>If you'd like to learn more, grab coffee with our head of engineering, check out some of our work on GitHub, let me know.  Or, do you know folks that may be interested?  Make the introductions and if we hire 'em, we'll send you a check for a cool $2,500/person.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the currency markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything. We
design and implement our own trading strategies and infrastructure,
down to the networking code that ties us in to financial markets. We
are a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add
one or two engineers who will focus on strategy or on infrastructure.<p>No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However,
you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be
able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of a project that a member of our infrastructure team could work on is a system for logging to non-volatile memory.  We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data.  NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss.  Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters.  Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable.  This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis.  Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more.  If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>For more details go to <a href="http://amacapital.net/careers.html" rel="nofollow">http://amacapital.net/careers.html</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5804986" href="vote?for=5804986_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%36%4d%35%58%66%55%4c%33%57%4a%7a%50%70%37%41%54%63%75%5a%57%55"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5804986"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zerr">zerr</a> 416 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5804986">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Union Square, San Francisco, CA. Full-time. Full-stack Engineer, All Levels.<p>Red Hot Labs (RHL) is looking for full-stack engineers at all levels that want to work on cutting edge mobile games and services for other mobile developers.<p>=Responsibilities=<p><pre><code>    - Write both server and client-side mobile code for iOS and Android apps. 
      (We can teach you this!)
    - Actively learn and work with new technologies. There’s a very good chance 
       you’ll pick up experience with a new language / technology stack here!
    - Collaborate closely with myself and the rest of our team to develop 
      products and services with a high quality user-experience. 
    - Architect and own big parts of our infrastructure. 

</code></pre>
=Your skills=<p><pre><code>    - REQUIRED: CS degree or significant experience in a low-level language (C, C++). 
         - We're trying to hire smart folks that have a solid CS foundation.
    - REQUIRED: Prior experience working with Javascript required.
    - REQUIRED: Ability to pick up new languages and frameworks quickly.
    - PREFERRED: Prior experience developing either business intelligence or games.
    - PREFERRED: Prior mobile experience in either iOS or Android.

</code></pre>
=Why Red Hot Labs=<p>We’re a small 6-person FUNDED startup founded by the guys who made FarmVille and CityVille. We’re building mobile games and supporting services that we think are missing from the mobile ecosystem. This is not our first startup; our last one was acquired by Zynga and led to them being able to IPO using our core-tech and games.<p>Our company culture is one built on learning and the belief that everyone is a student and everyone is a teacher. We want to work with folks that inspire us to learn more and do our best work. We invest in our employees and want to help you grow in both your core skill-set and other areas you may be interested in. We can afford to do this while we’re small.<p>We focus on shipping quickly and constantly (our first game was built in 6 weeks with no pre-existing client-side code), so this is a great place to experience shipping multiple products. Our product development process is a full-team collaborative one based on a healthy balance of metrics and design intuition. We care A LOT about good design and are always striving for putting out products we’re proud of both technically and visually.<p>Our tech-stack is built on accelerating the ability to ship. We’ve developed a unique client/server architecture that we use for all of our apps that allows us to write new backend connected mobile apps without having to write modify any server code. This backend combined with our unique embedded-JS frontend allows us to deploy fully featured cross-platform apps very quickly. Our first-game was featured on Google Play and was built in about 6 weeks.<p>=Perks=<p><pre><code>    - WORKCATIONS! We’re a small company so we do unscalable things such as 
      rent a house for the whole team and spend a week working from a Ski-house Tahoe 
      or in a beach-house in Hawaii. 
    - Early-stage startup equity grants
    - Health/Dental/Vision insurance
 
</code></pre>
=Our stack=<p><pre><code>    - An advanced client-side architecture written in C++ and 
      using embedded-JS bound to Objective-C/Java for our iOS and Android apps.
    - Redis, Couchbase, Rails for our backend API.
    - Mostly AWS with a little bit of Heroku for our hosting.
    - AngularJS, jQuery, Underscore for our dashboard and web apps.
    - 3rd party services: Twilio, Mailgun, Mixpanel, Crittercism, Testflight

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Netflix - Fulltime in Los Gatos, CA<p>We have a ton of positions open, but I'm looking for one in particular.  I'm hoping HN can help me come up with a good title for the position (We've been calling it Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) but the more people we talk to the more it sounds like that isn't quite right).  The job is:<p>1/3 of the time you'll be either the call leader for an outage situation or following up on a previous outage to determine root cause and what can be done to prevent that class of failure in the future.<p>1/3 of the you'll be working with teams throughout the company evangelizing best practices for reliability, scalability and distributed computing, such as helping them figure out caching strategies or how to use queues more effectively or avoiding global locks.<p>The last 1/3 of your time will be spent coding (mostly in Python) writing tools that help maintain the reliability of Netflix.  Some tools we have written are an intelligent alert routing gateway, and tool to keep track or changes throughout the AWS environment, and simple tools like one that keeps track of EIP assignments or collects tcpdumps to send to Amazon.<p>So HN, what do you think the title of this role should be?  Also, I didn't include the work DevOps in the description because it feels overused, but do you think it should be in there?</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5807140" href="vote?for=5807140_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%36%4d%35%58%66%55%4c%33%57%4a%7a%50%70%37%41%54%63%75%5a%57%55"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5807140"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bbunix">bbunix</a> 415 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5807140">link</a></span></div><br>

Many people believe that it's impossible to learn the basics of web development in just ten weeks but you'd be surprised to know how much a hard-working student can achieve in those 10 weeks :)<p>We started Makers Academy to do two things: help tech companies hire technical talent and to help people switch careers (being a Ruby dev is awesome!). We are a young VC-backed startup looking to change the way developers are taught.<p>I'm looking for instructors to help people switch careers into web development. It's a full-time job that involves lots of pairing with less experienced developers. If you make someone really understand how inject() works, it counts as a day well spent :)<p>We're also looking for guest speakers. If you'd like to share your experience with our students by giving a one-off Ruby-related talk, drop me a line, I'll buy you a lunch.<p>Email me at evgeny@makersacademy.com.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5803957" href="vote?for=5803957_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%36%4d%35%58%66%55%4c%33%57%4a%7a%50%70%37%41%54%63%75%5a%57%55"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5803957"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=aaaron">aaaron</a> 416 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5803957">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Berkeley, CA, Full Time<p>Are you looking to join a giant company? Hoping to turn your day into a dreary routine where your work will be marginalized? Well, you've come to the wrong place.<p>EasyESI is a 7-person, tech-led startup in downtown Berkeley that's changing how litigation is performed. Trust us: you'll like working with lawyers -- when they're paying you for a change. And they do pay us: we're comfortably cash-flow positive just two years after founding, and growing quickly.<p>We have many challenging problems, including machine learning, visualization, search, distributed systems, and nifty user interfaces. We're looking for generalists; we'll teach you (or you'll teach yourself) what you need to know.<p>We're a fun company, with an awesome location in downtown Berkeley, foosball, board games, and more (recent events: Warriors playoff game, ski weekend in Tahoe). We'll offer you a great salary, equity, health care, retirement with company matching, and a generous vacation schedule.<p>We are looking to fill 3 positions:<p>Software Engineer: We all wear many hats, contributing to a backend Java codebase that uses minimal XML. We use a lot of modern open source technologies: Lucene, Cassandra, AWS, etc. We have a separate Python codebase for performing offline work. We strive to write all of our code in a modular, reusable style that maximizes code-sharing and minimizes repetition. We schedule weekly time for refactoring so that we avoid the accumulation of technical debt. If you're sharp and you're interested in learning how to write performant code that uses modern academic research and operates on the latest infrastructure, you'll like this role.<p>Front-End/UI Engineer: Must have a good attention to detail and be able to use and contribute to a large, modular Javascript codebase (built on dojo). Good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is a must, and a good eye for design is a nice bonus. We support only modern browsers (no IE6 headaches), so we have a very rich HTML/Javascript interface that relies on AJAX queries to pull down data and perform much of the work.<p>Salesperson/Marketer:  You'll help manage our current client base, land new customers, and develop our company's marketing strategy and materials. However, since we’re a small, flexible team, you will not be tied down to a particular role. You'll have the opportunity shape product development and design your own projects to help grow our company.<p>Check out some videos of our product at <a href="http://easyesi.com/review.html" rel="nofollow">http://easyesi.com/review.html</a><p>We consider all applicants; please apply for the position(s) you're interested in at <a href="http://easyesi.com/jobs.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://easyesi.com/jobs.shtml</a>.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5883091" href="vote?for=5883091_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%36%4d%35%58%66%55%4c%33%57%4a%7a%50%70%37%41%54%63%75%5a%57%55"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5883091"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=magicpixelgames">magicpixelgames</a> 403 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5883091">link</a></span></div><br>

We are looking for someone to join our team working on native video SDKs.  We are a small team of 3 working on iOS and Android.  We plan on expanding to other platforms, possibly Xbox, Roku, etc.  Right now we looking for someone to come in and own our Android SDK, but who also isn't afraid to hack on some iOS or other platforms if needed.<p>You:<p><pre><code>    - Have current experience working with the Android SDK,
      though you may also have a background in JavaScript,
      Flex/AS3, Silverlight, Cocoa, or WPF.
    - Are able to think within the constraints of memory and
      network availability, yet still deliver sophisticated
      end user interactivity.
    - Understand the importance of proper version control
      and dependency management.  You love Git and Maven, or
      want to teach us how to use better tools.
    - Probably have strong opinions on programming
      languages, tools, and software architecture, but
      aren’t beholden to dogma – you are as interested in
      learning from others as you are in sharing your own
      ideas.
</code></pre>
Us:<p>We foster an atmosphere of learning and knowledge sharing by having regular lunch tech talks and also hosting many Boston-area developer meetups after-hours. Our engineers have 20%-time projects, unlimited vacation, freedom to work from home, and a great office overlooking the water by South Station. But these are just the perks. The real reason we’re here is to make great things.<p>Not required, but we'd be impressed if you also have:<p><pre><code>    - Experience programming with media playback technology
      (any platform)
    - Development experience on iOS, MacOSX, Windows Phone,
      or game consoles (Xbox/PS3)
    - Experience/interest in using RxJava and functional
      reactive programming
    - Links to published apps or your contributions to open
      source projects

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">New York, NY - Fulltime<p>Hiring: FE Engineer _#38; Head of Marketing/Biz-dev<p>iknow.io is a data-driven knowledge sharing community for curious people.
We take raw data about Movies, Music, Sports, Economics, Politics and more and make it possible for regular people to analyze and extract useful information from it. We also enable them to browse, share and discuss the fascinating insights they discover using our tools with one another.<p>While there are mountains of raw data out there, only scientists and programmers can currently make any real use of it. Our mission is to make that data accessible and useful to everyone.
Our team has extensive experience working with large, complex data problems and in building and nurturing online communities.<p>We are currently a team of 4 people, and are looking to add 2 more talented individuals to the mix soon.<p>1) FE Engineer: You have a great design sense and some serious engineering skills. You think the famous quote, "there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things" is spot on. Whenever you're browsing the web, you're constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved. You're a pragmatist who's ok with ignoring IE6 users. You've built complex, popular web-based applications before. You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead.<p>Our FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css. Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required. Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.<p>2) Head of Marketing _#38; Business Development: You're a natural born deal maker. When you throw a party, too many people show up. You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you. You believe product design and marketing are one and the same. You're ready to join an extremely talented product _#38; engineering team and show them that everything they thought they knew about how to really promote and grow a new site from the ground-up is wrong.<p>If you fit the bill for either of these positions, and you think what we're working on sounds intriguing, then we'd love to hear from you at jobs@iknow.io.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Transcriptic: Web Development, Electrical Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering<p>Menlo Park, CA<p>Transcriptic is "Amazon Web Services" for the life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>We're looking for people for three types of positions: web, EE, and ME.<p>On the web side, we're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer. On top of our robotic workcells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>On the hardware side, you'd be part of a small functional team (2-3 people) working on developing new hardware to solve specific problems.  We have in-house rapid prototyping and you'd also work with outsourced manufacture, whether in Sunnyvale or China.  Our MCAD is Solidworks-based; most people here use Eagle for electronics but that would be up to you.  Include a portfolio of projects you've worked on before; experience in robotics a major plus.  If you have HVAC experience, note the separately, too.  PhD is a plus but definitely not necessary.<p>We're a small startup (you'd be #11), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.<p>A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people.<p>max at transcriptic.com<p><a href="https://www.transcriptic.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.transcriptic.com/</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5807084" href="vote?for=5807084_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%36%4d%35%58%66%55%4c%33%57%4a%7a%50%70%37%41%54%63%75%5a%57%55"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5807084"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kamakazizuru">kamakazizuru</a> 415 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5807084">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Amobee -- Silicon Valley -- H1B, Intern, Full-time<p>I'm the technical lead at Amobee on our PULSE 3D platform, looking to disrupt the way we consume and create mobile advertising. We're looking for developers on HTML5, WebGL, iOS, and Android to build the next generation of rich media as well as touch-based content creation tools from the ground up.<p>We believe that ads should actually be fun; as fast, interactive and personalized as the best games and apps. That's why we built the world's first 3D platform for display advertising. Our startup, AdJitsu, was acquired by Amobee almost a year ago. Our team continues to operate like an autonomous startup, with the added benefit of our parent company's resources.<p>Our PULSE 3D platform combines WebGL (or native OpenGL on iOS) with HTML5 to create a designer-friendly environment for building interactive experiences powered by programmable shaders. You can have a look at some of our ads here: <a href="http://amobee.com/3d" rel="nofollow">http://amobee.com/3d</a><p>As a startup within a startup (we're a team of six people including three engineers with a lot of autonomy), you'll have the chance to own and solve problems such as:<p>* Build the next generation of realtime rendering and user interaction on mobile 
* Rethink content creation tools, from the ground up, for multi-touch interfaces 
* Design immersive, sensor-driven user experiences for clients 
* Analyze billions of data points from user interaction<p>We touch everything from SIMD assembly and fragment shaders, to Hadoop and Pig, and almost everything in between. Objective C, C++, HTML 5, Javascript, WebGL, Python, git and more are tools we use every day.<p>Our client include brands like BMW, Samsung, Autodesk, and Nokia. Our team brings experience from Apple, Cooliris, Dreamworks, Microsoft, Namco Bandai, NVIDIA, Ubisoft, and more. We're backed by the likes of Accel, Sequoia, and Singapore Telecom.<p>If this whets your appetite, get in touch with me at markw at amobee dot com and let's talk!</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_5809177" href="vote?for=5809177_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%36%4d%35%58%66%55%4c%33%57%4a%7a%50%70%37%41%54%63%75%5a%57%55"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_5809177"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=curveship">curveship</a> 415 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5809177">link</a></span></div><br>

The number of businesses using OpenStack in general and Swift in particular grows and grows, and it includes big names that make products that are used by both your little brother and your grandmother. You’ll work on a product that makes core OpenStack technology accessible to businesses of all kinds.<p>You’ll get open-source experience in a big way. At SwiftStack, we’re committed to strong participation in the OpenStack ecosystem in general and to contribution to Swift in particular. You’ll be a contributor to one of the most important Open Source projects currently active.<p>You’ll confront interesting problems every day. Writing a system like Swift and building a software ecosystem to surround it is the road less traveled. We aren’t writing yet another glorified CMS or social app or phone game. Whether it’s figuring out better algorithms for data placement, confronting a firehose of monitoring data, or determining how to integrate most flexibly with customers’ systems, there are always new and unusual problems to solve.<p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done. Tell us in a few lines of text why you’re interested in SwiftStack, and why we’ll be interested in you.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Buffer (<a href="http://bufferapp.com" rel="nofollow">http://bufferapp.com</a>) - Anywhere in the world (we're a distributed team of 8 people across the US, UK, Hong Kong and Sydney).<p>I'd love for you to come join Buffer for the fun ride. We have over 700,000 users and are on a $1.5m+ annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead, as we are looking to pass a million users in 2013. We are expecting even faster growth in the coming months through our mobile efforts.<p>We need help on 2 areas right now:<p>1. Android:<p><pre><code>    - Android is our second highest source of signups for Buffer, only
      trailing behind Web which was our original platform.
    - our users love the app, which has a 4.3 rating on Google Play.
    - the app has 100k+ total downloads and 3k daily active users.
    - we work with Google Play, Kindle and Blackberry stores.
</code></pre>
2. Full stack:<p><pre><code>    - we get 1,500-2,000 signups per day on the web
    - we have 170,000 weekly active users for our Chrome extension
    - 4,500 API clients. Most popular: Feedly, IFTTT, Pocket, Instapaper
    - we ship to production multiple times a day
    - we have a data-driven process, with Einstein, our custom
      built a/b testing framework
    - ideally, experience in: PHP (Codeigniter)/Python, MongoDB,
      Backbone.js Javascript, CSS, HTML
</code></pre>
We're a small team of driven hackers and happiness heroes (our support people). Just like you, we're excited and passionate about engineering challenges and have some interesting architecture and scaling problems we work on.<p>If you're interested in coming on board, you will:<p><pre><code>    - work closely myself on Product and Sunil on technical
      architecture
    - ship to thousands of users and iterate quickly
    - work with our metrics team to make smart changes
    - be friendly and comfortable talking directly to customers
      on issues and features
    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great
      approach in dealing with others
    - be a Buffer user (would be awesome, it’s cool if not)
    - be anywhere in the world, and if you'd like, you have help and
      support from us to move to where you want to be
    - have experience working with another startup before (would
      be awesome, it’s cool if not)
</code></pre>
Some aspects of Buffer culture that makes us a little different:<p><pre><code>    - we are totally transparent. We raised $450k, we currently
      have 700k users and generate $125k/mo. Ask me anything else!
    - within the company, all salaries and equity are open and we
      have a formula for the distribution.
    - we're all very focused on self improvement - we have daily
      standups where we discuss our current improvements. This
      could be waking up earlier, starting public speaking, blogging,
      exercise, learning a language, etc.
    - culture deck: http://www.slideshare.net/bufferapp/buffer-culture-02
</code></pre>
Salary: 88k-110k depending on location (living costs) and experience.<p>Equity: 0.5-1%<p>If this sounds fun, let's chat.
