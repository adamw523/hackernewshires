<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility for the right candidate)<p>---<p>At Khan Academy, we_#x27;re a small, 52-person non-profit tech startup. We_#x27;re trying hard to do good for the world. Here_#x27;s a testimonial we received just two days ago:<p><i>January 29, 2014</i><p><i>I am an adult returning to school for a midlife career change. I have always disliked math and thought I was bad at it -- and my last math class was over 20 years ago! But I just passed my Accuplacer placement test, thanks to Khan Academy. Thank you so much for making it fun and easy to refresh my skills. I also purchased the Accuplacer test prep app, but I found myself coming back to Khan Academy more often because I liked it more. Now I am learning coding at school, so I_#x27;ll definitely be back for more!</i><p><i>Lisa</i><p>This letter is one story, but every month we hear about hundreds of lives like this that we_#x27;ve transformed.<p>--<p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal_#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done <i>every week</i> on our site. That_#x27;s a lot.<p>With this huge scale, we_#x27;re able to study learning in a way that wasn_#x27;t previously possible. We_#x27;ve run tests and found that students learn more when they_#x27;re given harder problems based on an intelligent machine-learning algorithm [1]. Right now we have dozens of A_#x2F;B tests running to help us understand what we can do to make people learn more, such as testing how different spaced repetition algorithms affect retention. We_#x27;re also beginning to release anonymized student data to external researchers.<p>We_#x27;re doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two mobile devs so far. We_#x27;re totally overhauling our iOS app; if you join us now, you can be a main developer on an app that is <i>guaranteed</i> to have millions of users. This is a rare opportunity.<p>You_#x27;ll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business â€“ though we have _quot;celebrity_quot; devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google_#x27;s first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven_#x27;t heard of but who are also amazing.<p>Whether you_#x27;re a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. We really have a great team and culture. We use (and contribute to) new technology [3], we invest heavily in mentoring our interns (and full-timers) [4], we have lots of fun at and around work [5], and even though we_#x27;re a non-profit, we pay well too. I_#x27;m also proud to say that we_#x27;re winning against GitHub in team Bensity (i.e., percentage of employees named Ben) [6].<p>---<p>We_#x27;re hiring engineers (frontend, backend, mobile, data science), designers, and more -- if you_#x27;re a designer, you might also be interested in our parnership with Bridge [7]. And if you want to have an amazing summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we_#x27;re hiring interns too.<p>As I said above, mobile is a big priority for us. Let me know if you know someone great.<p>Please apply at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/careers" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.khanacademy.org_#x2F;careers</a> directly (say you saw us on HN!).

Where are customers having difficulty when buying prescription eyewear on our websites?

How can we build more usable tools?<p>Our backend is Python (Flask) and MongoDB, including bits of Celery, nginx, and uwsgi. We do a lot of integration with the UPS (in fact, we maintain an open-source UPS library [1]).

Both of these positions require you to be able to work in San Francisco, CA.<p>Systems engineers build and scale our infrastructure, and write mostly C, C++, and Python. These are the people working on our custom datastore. This position requires at least 2 years of experience writing systems software. Solid C experience is a plus.<p>Product engineers are full-stack developers who build the parts people interact with - reporting interfaces, APIs, dataviz stuff, and more - and write mostly Python, JS, and Less.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Academia.edu, San Francisco, CA<p>Academia.edu is trying to improve the way that scientific publishing works. Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.<p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.<p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.<p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes _quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world._quot; Over 7 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 800k plus join up each month.<p>If you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish. Our office is in downtown San Francisco.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Buffer (<a href="http://bufferapp.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;bufferapp.com</a>) - REMOTE (We_#x27;re a small distributed team of 16 people (5 engineers) across the US, UK, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Sweden and Australia)<p>I_#x27;d love for you to come join Buffer for the fun ride. We have over 1.2 million users and our annual run rate is over $3m. There are some super interesting challenges ahead, as we focus on Buffer for Business.
We_#x27;re looking to expand our engineering team with the following open positions.<p><pre><code>    * Android Hacker
    * Reliability Hacker (Devops engineer). 
    * Backend Hacker
    * iOS Hacker
</code></pre>
Here are some key stats about our technology and scale.<p><pre><code>    - we have over 150k monthly active users.
    - 8500+ API clients. Most popular: Feedly, IFTTT, Pocket, Instapaper
    - we release changes several times a day - we have an entirely data-driven process, with Einstein and Buffer-Metrics, our custom built a_#x2F;b testing and metrics tracking framework.
    - Some of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS.
</code></pre>
More stats and stack details here: <a href="http://overflow.bufferapp.com/2013/08/01/scaling-buffer-in-2013/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;overflow.bufferapp.com_#x2F;2013_#x2F;08_#x2F;01_#x2F;scaling-buffer-in-2...</a><p>We_#x27;re a small team of driven hackers and happiness heroes (our support people). Just like you, we_#x27;re excited and passionate about engineering challenges and have some interesting architecture and scaling problems we work on.
If you_#x27;re interested in coming on board, you’ll:<p><pre><code>    - work closely myself on technical architecture and Joel on product. 
    - ship to thousands of users and iterate quickly 
    - work with our metrics team to make smart changes 
    - be friendly and comfortable talking directly to customers on issues and features 
    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great approach in dealing with others 
    - be a Buffer user 
    - be anywhere in the world, and if you_#x27;d like, you have help and support from us to move to where you want to be 
    - have experience working with another startup or building side projects before (would be awesome, it’s cool if not)
</code></pre>
Some aspects of Buffer culture that makes us a little different:<p><pre><code>    - we are totally transparent. We raised $450k, we currently have over 1.1 million users and generate $230k_#x2F;mo. Ask me anything else! 
    - within the company, all salaries and equity are open and we have a formula for the distribution. 
    - we_#x27;re all very focused on self improvement 
    - we have daily standups where we discuss our current improvements. This could be waking up earlier, starting public speaking, blogging, exercise, learning a language, etc. 
    - here_#x27;s our culture deck: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.slideshare.net_#x2F;bufferapp_#x2F;buffer-culture-03
</code></pre>
Salary: 88k-110k depending on location (living costs) and experience.

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don_#x27;t artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I_#x27;ve worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and _gt; 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We_#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health_#x2F;vision_#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
    Just look here: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;beeradvocate.com_#x2F;beerfly_#x2F;city_#x2F;43

  - If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

We_#x27;ve been growing our team over the past few months, and looking to add even more awesome people. We work with dozens of API_#x27;s to show our users profiles of their customers without having to jump out of the email flow - imagine having <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtzqRSlgqkw" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.youtube.com_#x2F;watch?v=WtzqRSlgqkw</a> available when helping customers.<p>Thousands of people use it every day for hours on end, and are happy to pay for it to make sure they can continue using it. But there_#x27;s still so much polish and improvement possible.<p>We also spend time improving our tooling, and tools for other developers. As one example we_#x27;ve recently vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler and added reified keywords to the runtime to make ClojureScript a better citizen on the web. We do it because we want to give back to the communities that have enabled us, because it helps us, and because it_#x27;s interesting.
Looking for an engineer who loves the craft, who cares about building product, and is excited about helping customers.<p>Interested in working with Reactjs, Om, and functional programming in the client? We_#x27;re building a team that_#x27;s able to reduce complexity others balk at into simple, easy to reason about system, so we can continue to move quickly and delight both customers and ourselves.<p>This is both UI and backend work.<p>Languages: Clojure, Clojurescript, Javascript. sean @ zenboxapp <a href="https://www.zenboxapp.com" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.zenboxapp.com</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7162898 href="vote?for=7162898_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%31%36%32%31%39%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7162898></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bjelkeman-again">bjelkeman-again</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7162898">link</a></span></div><br>

You_#x27;ve put out every kind of fire and learned a lot in the process. You understand the tradeoffs of different data stores, server architectures, and low-level services.<p>Senior Data Engineer: You_#x27;ve built models which extract insights or predictions from large, living datasets.  You can engage with a dataset in an unfamiliar domain, grasp the dynamics of the system and impress subject area experts with your result.<p>Stupendous Junior Engineer: You don_#x27;t have years of working experience, but you have handful of mind-blowing personal or school projects.

Built from billions of inputs, the data is constantly updated by Factual’s real-time data stack. We were recently named one of _quot;50 Disruptive Companies in 2013_quot; by MIT Technology Review.

You are: a true full-stack engineer who has conceived, built, and launched your own projects. You have effectively managed and delegated to a team and to yourself. You’ll be the captain of the ship, getting it where it needs to be, on time and on budget. Your job will be to invent your role and build the team that allows you to fill it. You don_#x27;t want to be the _quot;tech guy_quot; working with _quot;business guys._quot; You and the two founders will be the executive team, and together we_#x27;ll all make decisions about the business.<p>Our Mission<p>Developers, publishers, and all sellers of digital content are missing out on billions of dollars. That’s because an enormous share of their audience — often greater than 90% — stops at the paywall. Unlockable helps change the equation for selling digital media, from games to apps to streaming services and beyond: by letting people pay with their time in a fun, ad-supported experience.<p>Our Product<p>Unlockable lets people pay for content by playing ad-based games. Anywhere a _quot;Buy_quot; button can go, an _quot;Unlock” button can go next to it. All of our games use only existing video ads with no additional production, making it extremely easy for brands to get started. Publishers can earn more revenue from their existing audience, brands get guaranteed engagement on existing video, and players get a free way to access paid content.

We_#x27;ve grown 100% quarter over quarter all last year. Our team has surged to 30+ people and the waves of revenue washed together to form a rushing roar with just one of our products going from nothing to $100k_#x2F;month in just 9 months.<p>Being a media company we find our way into all kinds of cool stuff. Our office is furnished with things like a $3000 high-end bed that was sent to us to review. We got to talk to and get pictures with Warren Buffett and Lloyd Blankfein (CEO of Goldman Sachs) when they came to Detroit last week.<p>But, you interject, finance is one of the toughest startup seas to sail upon! The old boys club runs an ironclad ship with no visible decks for boarding. Avast! We_#x27;ve built a battering ram of a business in just a few short years that has pummeled its way deep into the heart of Wall Street. Old Ironsides has warmed itself to Benzinga and once a taste the thirst cannot be quenched.<p>We_#x27;ve recently became Microsoft_#x27;s premier finance partner alongside 3 other companies, all worth over a billion dollars and established for years. As of this Christmas season we will be installed by default on 500 million desktops and tablets via Windows 8 Finance. No download necessary. That_#x27;s right mateys, we_#x27;re in the source code.<p>And if you happen to trade or invest yourself you_#x27;ll find us inside almost all of the major brokerages in the US.<p>So, where do you fit in this rigging, you swashbuckling scalawag? Well, our team is crazy ambitious, motivated, and experienced with shaking shit up. If you know your tech, and want on deck this is the place to do it. Your exact technical background and language of choice doesn_#x27;t matter as much as your motivation and your ability to adapt quickly. We are a young team and we_#x27;re especially looking for sailors who_#x27;ve got some salt in their whiskers who can help us scale from millions to hundreds of millions.<p>Why be a ninja when you can be a pirate?

We’re replacing cumbersome and expensive business processes that are currently handled by a hodge-podge of Excel, aging competitors, and repetitive human tasks. Our users love us (and pay us) because we make consultants and their clients happier and more efficient at doing their jobs.<p>Our roadmap is clear, both due to strong relationships with our customers, and due to our founders’ experience in the services industry. With each month, we find our product moving further and further upmarket as it tackles increasing complexity and scale. We’re looking for more smart people to help us build business software that’s both powerful and easy to use.<p>Who<p>We’re looking for senior engineers who enjoy teaching and learning from others. You are passionate about writing maintainable, reusable, well-tested code. You enjoy pairing and applying TDD when appropriate. You don’t shy away from diving into a large (but very well tested!) Rails application to refactor it into components and services. You’re excited to work on a team creating intuitive UIs in Backbone.Marionette and CoffeeScript, developing reusable JSON APIs, and extracting and releasing open source components.<p>It’s hard to measure experience in years meaningfully, but you should have a strong background in Ruby and Ruby on Rails, as well as JavaScript and ideally CoffeeScript. We’d expect something on the order of 2-3 years of full-time Ruby experience.<p>Experience in the following would help you get up to speed and start committing on day one:<p>* RSpec and Jasmine<p>* CoffeeScript<p>* Sass and modular CSS<p>* Backbone _#x2F; Backbone.Marionette<p>* API design<p>Benefits and Work Environment<p>* We offer competitive salary, benefits, equity, and a fun and casual work environment.<p>* Because we pair most of the time, we work regular, predictable hours, starting at 9:30am with a brief morning stand-up, and ending at 6pm. We won’t ask you to stay late or work weekends except in truly exceptional situations. We care about work-life balance.<p>* We send interested employees to conferences to speak or just to learn. The whole 16 person engineering team has attended GoGaRuCo (Golden Gate Ruby Conference) here in San Francisco two years running, and we’ve given talks at a number of Ruby conferences.<p>* Our development workflow is a combination of pairing and soloing, with pull requests and code review.<p>* We use Pivotal Tracker to break down and estimate features and Travis for continuous integration of our test suite.<p>* We’ve seen the benefits of test-driven, high-quality code first hand, and we know what happens when code spikes turn into production code and become unmaintainable. You will have full-buyin from the team to spend time testing and writing maintainable code.<p>* We always striving to have the most enjoyable and productive environment. We conduct periodic team retrospectives where we discuss what’s working, what’s not working, and how we can improve everyone’s experience.<p>* We’re located in downtown San Francisco, two blocks from the Embarcadero BART.<p>Apply<p>Send your resumé, GitHub profile, or other examples of your work to jobs@mavenlink.com<p>Ask us questions! We believe that you should always ask probing questions about a company’s trajectory, funding, and plans when considering employment, especially at a startup. Please, ask us anything!

We are now looking for a business co-founder and leader to unlock this potential.<p>We’re looking for someone who knows the relevant entertainment markets (including both traditional at-home game consoles and the out-of-home entertainment market); is skilled at business and strategic planning; has experience getting integrated hardware_#x2F;software products to wide distribution; can get us the right industry partners; can lead fundraising as needed; has executive management potential; and is generally a excellent person who is fun and inspiring to work with.<p>Our game table is being featured this month at IndieCade East, the annual independent games festival, at New York’s Museum of the Moving Image. We think it’s both gorgeous and ergonomically unique, comfortably sitting up to 6 players with plenty of leg room. (Design has been led by a cutting-edge architecture firm headed by MIT_#x2F;Harvard architecture professors.) Technically, it’s a smart combination of open-source and proprietary software, including our own game framework built on Unity3D. (The core table engineering was led by an MIT Media Lab expert in multi-touch tables.) Unlike many interactive tables, it’s cool and smooth to the touch and is seamless and spill-proof; having a cocktail or beer at the table is encouraged by design. We already have around a dozen games working on the table -- ranging in stage from alpha to polished, some our own, some from third-parties indie game developers.<p>In short, we think we’ve created a special product that enables a unique and wonderful face-to-face game experience -- bringing the best of digital technology into a fully present, truly social interaction. Now we’re looking for a co-founder to turn an exceptional product into an exceptional business.<p>Additional background: the founder and creative director of Grasshopper NYC is an MIT engineer with a track record of product and business innovation in new media, including high-level executive positions in business news and as as a product management director at Google. A blog post in Gamasutra, a leading games industry website, noted that Grasshopper NYC is being talked about as “the coolest thing happening in the New York game industry at the moment.”<p>Interested?

shared web pages every day, automatically classify them into tens of thousands
of topics, and serve up personalized feeds in real-time using our homegrown,
lightning fast, machine learning-based relevance engine.  We are looking to
grow our top-notch team, with both junior and senior-level positions available.<p>We are looking for engineers with deep interest and knowledge in at least one 
area core to our business (i.e., distributed systems, ops and tooling, machine
learning, designing and building new product features). We’re a small team, so
you will have the opportunity to have a lot of impact, and to learn from peers
who are extremely talented engineers, computer scientists, and data experts.
Our backend is written entirely in Clojure, a JVM-based LISP that is a dream to
work in. Almost none of us knew it before we joined, and we don’t expect you to
either. We do, however, expect the following:<p>- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess.
- You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs.
- You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful.
- You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two.
- You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are.
- You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.<p>Here’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:<p>- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive
- Building out new product features in our API 
- Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly
- Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more
- Creating tools to assist development and ops 
- Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7162703 href="vote?for=7162703_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6b%6b%78%6f%6b%42%30%7a%72%43%30%74%47%77%64%4e%6d%4c%61%67%39%50"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7162703></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=arupchak">arupchak</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7162703">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am curently the only employee) and aim to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and_#x2F;or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Visit <a href="http://amacapital.net/careers.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;amacapital.net_#x2F;careers.html</a> to learn more, and send applications_#x2F;inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7169364 href="vote?for=7169364_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6b%6b%78%6f%6b%42%30%7a%72%43%30%74%47%77%64%4e%6d%4c%61%67%39%50"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7169364></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=martian">martian</a> 91 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7169364">link</a></span></div><br>

Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, at the moment we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalizing specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we_#x27;d like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who_#x27;d like to join us; we_#x27;re hiring for all technical roles, especially developers of all levels of experience.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is the UK_#x27;s leading private shopping club, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>NODE.JS, ANDROID and PRODUCT MANAGEMENT positions in Berlin_#x2F;Germany—all full-time and permanent<p>Top 5 reasons why you should move to Berlin, now:<p>1. Lowest livings costs with highest quality of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun. In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one and the rest applies for the hassle-free Blue Card.<p>5. Berlin_#x27;s night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.<p>Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, we’d love to talk with you. If you don_#x27;t live in Berlin yet, we could help to fix that.<p>All job offers =_gt; <a href="http://urge.io/jobs" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;urge.io_#x2F;jobs</a><p>Mail addresse =_gt; career _lt;at_gt; versus _lt;dot_gt; com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7163332 href="vote?for=7163332_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6b%6b%78%6f%6b%42%30%7a%72%43%30%74%47%77%64%4e%6d%4c%61%67%39%50"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7163332></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=late2part">late2part</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7163332">link</a></span></div><br>

About OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc: OpenEye Scientific Software provides software to the pharmaceuticals industry for molecular modeling and cheminformatics. It has done so since 1997 in its continuing mission to provide novel software, new science and better business practices to the industry. Central to our approach is the importance of shape and electrostatics as primary variables of molecular description, platform-independent code for high-throughput 2D and 3D modeling, and a preference for the rigorous rather than the ad hoc.
With offices in the United States, Germany _amp; Japan, OpenEye Scientific Software is a global company. However, with fewer than 50 employees we offer a unique working culture.

We_#x27;re looking for our very first DevOps engineer to join our team in the West Loop.<p>This candidate should enjoy learning new technologies and solving hard problems. Ideally, we_#x27;re looking for someone that can whip or systems engineering stack into shape, taking over cross-cutting systems work that we each handle on our individual projects. Our existing team of 7 are mostly programmers. We_#x27;ve had to learn tools such as Vagrant, Puppet and AWS to make our lives easier, but we_#x27;re growing to the point where we could really use someone who lives and breathes this stuff.<p>We work quite a bit with OSS and we_#x27;re not shy about jumping into other people_#x27;s code to figure things out. We constantly hunt for smarter ways to do things, so we_#x27;re often experimenting with emerging tech with little or no documentation.

We have 3-7 projects going at any point in time. We tend to focus on greenfield development, building web applications from the ground up. We also work on integrating the old with the new, bringing technologies like Elasticsearch, Grails and Drools to large companies. Helping people make better decisions is the central theme of most of our projects. This can take the form of a search engine to help people find interesting stuff to do on a Saturday night, a complex rules-oriented workflow management system for evaluating health insurance claims, helping people find the right doctor, or a matchmaking and scheduling system to help people book face-to-face meetings at conferences.
In the next year or two, we also plan to get into product development, taking our experiences solving the same sort of problems for multiple clients and rolling them into a generic framework which we plan to open source and support directly for our clients and the rest of the world.<p>===<p>We offer full health, vision and dental for our full-time employees. 401K. Free snacks and often free lunches as well. Big monitors and top-of-the-line equipment. We also have a shiny new office treadmill.<p>Drop us a line at jobs@spantree.net and tell us a bit about yourself. If you have a resume or CV, feel free to pass that along as well.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire
Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do _quot;expense reports that don_#x27;t suck!_quot; (Google _quot;expensify_quot; to read more.) We_#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren_#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it_#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won_#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn_#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We_#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We_#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing_#x2F;designing_#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you_#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you_#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you_#x27;re this sort of person, you_#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn_#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That_#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it_#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I_#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don_#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href="https://we.are.expensify.com/apply" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;we.are.expensify.com_#x2F;apply</a>).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>MailChimp - Atlanta, GA<p>Database Engineer<p>MailChimp is a DIY email-newsletter service based in Atlanta that serves more than 4 million users worldwide. We_#x27;re self-funded and profitable, and we_#x27;re growing fast.<p>Job Description
MailChimp is seeking a database-focused infrastructure engineer to join our team. You’ll build, maintain, and monitor systems that support millions of users across all products and applications at the company. We operate in a high volume environment and are growing rapidly, adding 10000+ new accounts_#x2F;day with that rate increasing every week. On the infrastructure side we do interesting work to support that scale and growth rate, working closely with developers to build and support our applications.<p>The engineering teams are small and focused, our benefits are unmatched, and internally we function much like a startup aside from established stability and abundant resources. There are no sales people, no investors, no board, and engineering teams are trusted to make good decisions with resources with minimal oversight.  We are competitive nationally on salary and benefits.<p>Applicants should have strong Linux experience, extremely heavy operational MySQL experience, independent troubleshooting skills, and a love for automation and monitoring.  Our core persistence layer consists of hundreds of horizontally sharded and paired Percona 5.5 instances. We are seeking an experienced engineer who would be part of the core infrastructure team with a focus on maintaining and improving this crucial MySQL layer in addition to contributing to the systems that feed off of it (emailgenome.org, Elasticsearch, Postgres, Redis). We take a pragmatic and practical approach to our stacks using proven components and building our own logic and complexity on top of well understood building blocks. This is a large, well built setup with consistent hardware, configs, monitoring, backups, and tuning in place.<p>Skills and Experience:
- Linux servers
- Experience with modern MySQL at high volume: sharding, replication, backups, monitoring, tuning
- Knowledge of the current MySQL ecosystem and an interest in where things are headed
- Deep understanding of InnoDB performance, recovery, tuning, and backups
- Experience with replication and an understanding of all options and components involved
- Exposure to HA solutions like MMM, haproxy, PXC
- Scripting and coding (python, bash, php)
- Puppet or other configuration management tool experience is a big plus
- Zabbix or other monitoring tools
- Familiarity with other infrastructure pieces of our stacks (nginx, apache, memcache, postgres, redis, elasticsearch) is also a big plus<p>Please apply here, the applications come directly to me:<p><a href="http://mailchimp.theresumator.com/apply/oJIqi3/Database-Engineer.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;mailchimp.theresumator.com_#x2F;apply_#x2F;oJIqi3_#x2F;Database-Engi...</a><p>Many other positions available as well:<p><a href="http://mailchimp.theresumator.com/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;mailchimp.theresumator.com_#x2F;</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr style="height:10px"></tr><tr><td class="title"><a href="/x?fnid=eUVSRVFiwgG5ggRc8UpTVz" rel="nofollow">More</a></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=10 width=0><table width="100%" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=1><tr><td bgcolor=#ff6600></td></tr></table><br>

We forecast at this level as real estate truly is local, and we’ve found there are huge differences in how markets move between zip codes in a county.  Our forecasts have over 90% accuracy forecasting housing prices up to 3 years out for most US real estate markets.  We have back-tested these models for accuracy over the past 40 years, so that we can have confidence in calling the major market turns, and also understand where we are in the cycle and the likely future returns.<p>We are currently working with sophisticated institutions such as homebuilders, land investors, mortgage banks, etc. to use these forecasts.<p>We will be building housecanary.com into a full consumer oriented website in early 2014.  We want to provide property owners in the US with a simple and accurate forecast for what is likely to happen to their home_#x27;s value over the next few years (at a zip code level), given that a home represents most people_#x27;s single largest investment in life. There are many people who want to better understand and plan for future price swings, similar to how they manage the rest of their financial assets, however currently, there is insufficient information available to consumers.  We can now provide 80M US households with powerful data_#x2F;forecasts only the largest banks and hedge funds had access to historically.<p>Positions available:<p>UI_#x2F;UX Designer - Our ideal designer will be able to build beautiful and simple web sites, help out with product design and implement the designs in HTML and CSS.  However being able to code is not required, just a huge plus.  We’re building very data driven products, so experience working on analytic heavy sites is also a plus.<p>Frontend developer - Our frontend is compiled statically (hosted on s3 and cloudfront) and all data is pulled via angular from our API.  Our graphs are built using d3.js, we use SASS as our css preprocessor and grunt for our builds and deployment.  Our ideal frontend developer will have prior experience with angular and prior experience building out analytic driven sites<p>We’re a small but growing team, so your work will have large impact of the future success of the company.  And as one of our first hires you will rewarded with meaningful equity in the company.<p>We have an office in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco. We cover health, dental and vision for all of our employees.  Please note, we’re currently only looking to hire people who are located in the US or have US work authorization.<p>If interested please email joey@housecanary.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7168304 href="vote?for=7168304_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%65%55%56%53%52%56%46%69%77%67%47%35%67%67%52%63%38%55%70%54%56%7a"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7168304></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=archerabi">archerabi</a> 92 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7168304">link</a></span></div><br>

United States.<p>Climate_#x27;s technical staff numbers around 80, and we_#x27;re hiring full-time
employees and interns across many teams as we expand efforts on a new class of
decision support tools for growers. Work is split across groups focusing on web
applications for farmers and agents, risk and insurance policy management,
internal platform and data services, and scientific modeling and research, with
roles for:<p>1. Software engineering generalists with solid CS fundamentals, particularly
anyone interested in building (i) entirely new, large-scale distributed data
services for scientific computing (we use Clojure); and (ii) web applications
(Rails, Python, Javascript, and iOS) used by farmers to manage weather risk.<p>2. Quantitative researchers in statistics_#x2F;ML, stochastic optimization, remote
sensing, atmospheric physics, and agronomics. Our goal is to forecast
statistical distributions of crop yield for any piece of arable land,
synthesizing satellite images, digital elevation models, weather data,
agricultural statistics, and geological surveys into multiscale models that
underly our data services.<p>3. Experienced technical team leads, operations engineers, product managers,
and designers to pull all this together into a compelling product.<p>The scale and interdiscplinary nature of the work drive a lot of
cross-collaboration within the company, supported by a pressing need to build
durable solutions to some very important problems.<p>Competitive salary, excellent benefits, stock options, etc. Our 25% time is

All while managing risk  and delivering superior results?<p>If this sounds like a typical day in your dream job, then we’d love to hear from you!

What_#x27;s _quot;containerization_quot;? The name comes the LXC technology (Linux Containers), and the technique is also known as _quot;Lightweight Virtualization_quot;.<p>That_#x27;s why we recently launched Docker (<a href="http://www.docker.io/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.docker.io_#x2F;</a>), an Open Source tool enabling anyone to run those Linux Containers very easily. Containers boot 1000x faster than virtual machines; their disk and memory footprint are also much lower; and they work on virtually all current platforms (from physical servers to public cloud instances). We think that they are the future of virtualization, and will soon become ubiquitous.<p>Convinced? Then fork the repo on github (<a href="https://github.com/dotcloud/docker" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;github.com_#x2F;dotcloud_#x2F;docker</a>) and have a look at the code. Not convinced?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>SVBio: Foster City, CA (next to San Mateo, in the SF Bay Area): Full-time
=========================================================================
SVBio (<a href="http://svbio.com/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;svbio.com_#x2F;</a>) is looking for the most talented full-stack software engineer with experience and understanding of web architecture design and implementation, following best and up-to-date practices. The work will further enhance the application of our clinical-grade genome interpretation engine. As leaders in the field, we drive the vision of the genome-interpretation product down to the last detail - only modern browsers are supported here!
Knowledge of some specific technologies is greatly desired (see below), but not necessarily required for the right hacker. Knowledge of javascript is a must, as well as the desire to write clean and maintainable code. Knowledge of the genome and next-generation-sequencing technologies is really nice to have, but definitely not required. SVBio is a tightly-knit organization with people from many diverse disciplines and backgrounds, so being an all-around friendly person is a must.
Anyone who is interested should contact me (elicudine -A-T- svbio.com) directly with your background, a resume_#x2F;c.v., some previous work samples, a github link, whatever you think might help me out.
---Preferable knowledge_#x2F;experience---
- Significant proven experience, both in frontend and backend technologies.
- Dynamic frontends (angular.js, angular-ui, JQuery, d3.js)
- Advanced backend architectures (at least one of: node.js, express_#x2F;hapi_#x2F;geddy_#x2F;koa, flask, twisted, django, sinatra, rails)
- Scalable persistency layers (HDFS, Postgres, mysql, mongodb)
- Other tools (grunt.js, bower.js, require.js)
- Testing frameworks (at least one of: chai.js, mocha.js, karma, capybara, cucumber, istanbul, supertest)
-- Additional valuable experience:
- Strong scripting knowledge (e.g., python, perl, bash)
- An eye for aesthetics</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7165821 href="vote?for=7165821_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%65%55%56%53%52%56%46%69%77%67%47%35%67%67%52%63%38%55%70%54%56%7a"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7165821></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=timonv">timonv</a> 92 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7165821">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Seeking Technical Co-Founder for Nonprofit Startup<p>We are an exciting nonprofit seeking to make the world a better place by connecting international travelers with daylong volunteering opportunities in order to bring more resources to vetted nonprofit organizations around the world.<p>We believe that by re-engineering international volunteering and making it open to micro-contributions we can create new revenue streams for worthy nonprofit organizations and increase awareness of global issues across a wide demographic of travelers.<p>We have been working on this project since August 2012 and we incorporated in July 2013. We have laid legal groundwork (applied for 501c3 and have temporary fiscal sponsor), have considerable traction with fundraising, partner organizations (6 confirmed, 6 in the works), and a few initial pilot users.<p>We have one full-time co-founder and two part-time co-founders - none are technical. We are seeking a technical co-founder to lead our technical strategy (including but not limited to crowdfunding and social engagement), to take on projects (including but not limited to web development and CRM), and to to be a decision-making member of our core team. Web Development experience required.<p>The ideal candidate can contribute 8-10 hours per week, but would be able to go full time if we are admitted into a incubator program (we plan to apply to 3+ programs this year). No compensation is currently available, but is negotiable pending funding.<p>We are striving to create an organizational culture that values innovation, transparency, and integrity. We are a fun core group with a dynamic extended community of volunteers and supporters.<p>A passion for making the world a better place and engaging global issues is essential.<p>If interested, please email kerry@giveadayglobal.org, tell her billy sent you :)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7162589 href="vote?for=7162589_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%65%55%56%53%52%56%46%69%77%67%47%35%67%67%52%63%38%55%70%54%56%7a"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7162589></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ryanshow">ryanshow</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7162589">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Lima, Peru -AND- Boston, MA -- Full Stack Junior Developer Fellowship opportunity!<p>---<p>About Entrepreneurial Finance Lab:<p>EFL_#x27;s mission is to expand access to finance in emerging markets by equipping banks with better tools to measure credit risk. Built with the aim of tackling a 2.5 trillion dollar financing gap for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) around the world, EFL_#x27;s digital psychometric credit assessment evaluates small business owners on key elements of entrepreneurship in a scalable and automated manner. This breakthrough technology helps banks provide financing to market segments previously out of reach, and helps bring the developing world_#x27;s most capable, yet previously unbankable, entrepreneurs into the formal financial fold. After spinning off from a research initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School_#x27;s Center for International Development, EFL now works with leading financial institutions across Africa, Asia, and Latin America, and has facilitated over $240 million in lending to SMEs. We’ve been recognized and endorsed by leading development organizations such as the IFC, Inter-American Development Bank, and the G-20.<p>---<p>About the Fellowship:<p>The two-year Global Technology Fellowship provides an opportunity for young, driven individuals with a background in computer science and software engineering to gain exposure to a quickly growing and highly accredited startup in the field of emerging market technology. Your mission will be to tackle engineering challenges at the intersection of data science and software development.  We are re-engineering our infrastructure and will need help in designing for growth.  The Fellowship will be based in Lima, Peru and Boston, MA for the duration of the first year, and you will also have the opportunity to engage with EFL clients in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. We at EFL view first-hand exposure to emerging markets as an essential component of the fellowship and guarantee at least six weeks of on the ground experience within your first year.<p>Projects you may be asked to take on in your first year are:<p>Web Development
•      Enhancements to the EFL Web App to meet new customer feature needs (Django and JQuery)
•      Implementation of automated continuous integration (Git, Jenkins, and AWS)<p>Scoring Systems
•      Enhancements to support faster asynchronous scoring and reporting needs (Celery)
•      Enhancements to async infrastructure configuration to support redundancy (AWS and Celery)<p>UX_#x2F;UI Projects
•      Android Mobile tools development (Android)
•      Enhancements to the EFL Web App (Django_#x2F;CSS_#x2F;XHTML)<p>R_amp;D Projects
•      Mobile, GIS, and Social scoring enhancements to the core EFL algorithm (NoSQL, R)<p>Client Integration Projects
•      Enhancements to the EFL REST API (Python) 
•      Client integration projects (varies)<p>Based on your contributions in your first year,  EFL will offer you a position for a second and final year of the fellowship. This position may be a continuation of one of the projects you worked on in year one, or it may be a new opportunity in one of our global markets. Your success in both years of the fellowship will depend on your ability to learn quickly in situations that are foreign, to think critically through complex challenges, to take initiative as opportunities present themselves, and to execute efficiently and effectively.<p>Additional Fellowship Opportunities:<p>As a Global Technology Fellow, you will have the opportunity to engage with EFL’s senior leadership to gain exposure to other areas of the business including sales, project management, credit modeling and statistics.  You’ll be joining a tight-knit corps of EFL Fellows with an array of skillsets and shared ambitions in the field of emerging market technology, and will have access to leading practitioners of development economics. Fellows are highly encouraged to utilize these resources during their time with EFL. For more information on current and past Fellows, visit eflglobal.com_#x2F;efl-fellowship.<p>---<p>Qualifications:<p>Required Qualifications:

Our software increases the efficiency of primary care physicians, provides specialist physicians with a better patient mix, and allows insurance companies and healthcare systems to help ensure patients stay in network. As a result, patients get higher quality, more affordable, more appropriate care with better outcomes.<p>I would love to hear from you whether you_#x27;re interested in joining us (awesome!) or just want to chat.

Some of the development is open source (we are the primary contributors to Cassandra core, which is an Apache Foundation project...)<p>I just joined recently; as a senior developer with startup experience, I had lots of offers from various companies.  The reasons I chose DataStax were:<p>- 100% remote means I can work from whereever I want (I like to travel) and whenever, within reason, as long as I get my stuff done
 - the opportunity to work on interesting new technology that is rapidly changing and being adopted by a lot of Fortune 100, etc
 - they have been vocal about their plans to IPO in the next few years and are growing like crazy<p>Very competitive salary, lots of open positions: Java, Python, JS, I_#x27;ve even seen some Clojure.

Cutting to the chase:<p>BAGGU (baggu.com) is looking for a well-rounded developer to help us continue to build web-based software tools at our studio in San Francisco.<p>It may seem out of place on HN since we_#x27;re not VC funded, and we make physical products — but technology has been a big part of BAGGU since the beginning. Our website, content management and ordering systems are developed internally. There is a constant dialogue between designers and developers. We build things that suit our needs, and solve problems quickly. Product design, graphic design, photography and interactive all happen in-house. We are a small, close-knit team. It’s a fun and collaborative environment.<p>Our stack is composed of Node.js, Redis and CouchDB on the backend, with Backbone, JQuery and Less (compiled and minified, of course) on the client. Most of our JavaScript is written in CoffeeScript. We use Git and are deployed on Amazon infrastructure. We love building things from scratch, and we’d love to find someone who could lead us toward releasing our tools as open source.<p>Familiarity with components of our stack is important, but most important is that you are disciplined, self-motivated, and fit well into a collaborative creative environment. We’re happy to take on someone technically adept who can learn quickly. You don’t need a CS degree, but you need to both eagerly solve problems that are thrown at you and lead the development of larger projects.<p>To give you a feel for it, these are some examples of things you could be working on:
- You figure out that ordering system doesn’t seem to be consuming orders via Redis fast enough. Time to get in there and figure out why.
- It would be convenient if wholesale customers had a portal they could use to process payment. Lay out a roadmap for making this happen, then impliment.
- View rendering on the client is sometimes too slow. Explore some options for server-sided rendering with some quick mock-ups so we can evaluate a timeframe for making it happen.<p>We are a small business that values a healthy work life balance. There’s plenty to do, but we prefer to get it done at a consistent pace. No weekends and very rare late nights.<p>Qualified applicants will submit a CV and cover letter that detail their relevant experience and related projects. Get in touch with it@baggu.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7162918 href="vote?for=7162918_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%79%44%67%75%66%66%75%38%6b%38%49%6b%65%57%50%34%32%43%79%52%4b"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7162918></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dberg">dberg</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7162918">link</a></span></div><br>
