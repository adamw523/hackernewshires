<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>We are a tech company. We just don't look like one :) Tom (tptacek) always accuses me of not selling enough, so I'll give it a try.<p>Your question is actually very open-ended. We have roughly 4,000 R_#38;D employees, so you can imagine the work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.).<p>I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level "app" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.<p>All of what I mentioned is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R_#38;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion "ticks" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one "feed") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)<p>We could use a motto like "We do a lot of stuff."</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5484930 href="vote?for=5484930_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%34%37%32%37%34%36"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5484930></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zerr">zerr</a> 60 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5484930">link</a></span></div><br>

Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>We're looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer.  On top of our robotic workcells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI.  Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user.  We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you'd be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>We're a very small startup (you'd be #6), but well funded and have customers.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA. Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people think that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things may happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 1.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 4,000 join each day.<p>We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href="http://academia.edu/hiring" rel="nofollow">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission here <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/</a> (The Future of Peer Review) and here <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/</a> (The Future of Science)<p>We want to hire world class engineers. We want you to join us in building the future of science whether you are based in San Francisco, New York, Delhi, or Beijing. Remote work is fine. We will handle re-location, including visas, if you would like to re-locate, but re-location is not necessary.<p>If you are interested to learn more, please email Ryan Jordan at ryanj [at] academia.edu</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5483875 href="vote?for=5483875_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%34%37%32%37%34%36"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5483875></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=scottshea">scottshea</a> 60 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5483875">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Chapel Hill, NC<p>Raleigh, NC<p>Durham, NC<p>Remote - maybe, see below.<p>Fogbeam Labs.<p>At Fogbeam Labs, we're not just "putting the enterprise in enterprise social network", and we're not just re-inventing enterprise software, we're re-inventing the enterprise!  Old fashioned "command and control" structures can't adapt fast enough for today's dynamic, fast-paced business environment and the enterprises of the future will feature adaptive, sense _#38; respond management, built on top of emergent networks and teams that assemble, overcome a challenge and disperse only to form again elsewhere.<p>We are bringing together Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Social Network Analysis, Social Networking, Business Process Management, Workflow Automation, Business Intelligence and Knowledge Management to build tools to provide enterprises the capabilities they need to collaborate and compete in this new era.<p>We are a "pure play" Open Source company where all of our products are developed in the open, licensed under <i>real</i> Open Source licenses (mostly Apache Software License v2), developed collaboratively with the community. We don't do "throw it over the wall" code dump style "open source" ala Android or whatever.<p>Do you love Open Source, and radically cool technologies?  Do you like the idea of using awesome technology to solve gnarly business problems? Have you ever found yourself daydreaming about things like "Could there be an actual commercial application for Plan 9" or "How could a business use an immersive 3D virtual reality type world for something productive"?   If so, you might want to talk to us...  We're looking for hackers, sales-people and interns as follows:<p>#SALES#<p>Looking for inside and outside sales people.  Experience selling enterprise software solutions is desirable, but we're also very open to training someone from the ground up.  If you enjoy interacting with people, have a highly social nature, like solving hard problems and want to make a pile of money in the process, get in touch.  Experience with a well known sales methodology such as Solution Selling is a bonus, but not absolutely required.  Remote work arrangements possible, depending on details.  Call us and let's talk.  We really are interested in everything from demonstrated sales superstars to newbies who have never sold before (yes, we'll train the right person(s)).<p>#INTERNS#<p>Looking for a chance to work with some really exciting technology over the summer, contribute to the Open Source world, and learn all about life in a self-funded, bootstrapped startup?  Consider interning with us this summer.  Internships might be paid or unpaid depending on some details, but at the very minimum we can promise you a glowing reference letter, recommendations (assuming you really <i>do</i> good work, of course!) and access to our networks for future purposes. And, depending on how things shake out, maybe a job offer if things go well.  If you like the idea of working with Groovy, Grails, Mahout, Solr, Lucene, UIMA, OpenNLP, Camel, Hadoop, etc. -  and you're interested in graph theory, social network analysis, text mining, machine learning, etc. - ping us.  Interns would need to be onsite in the Chapel Hill / Raleigh / Durham area<p>#COFOUNDER#<p>We're open to adding another member to the founding team.  We're 2 people now, down from a previous 3, due to one co-founder being overwhelmed by life circumstances and choosing to step aside.  An ideal potential co-founder would fit one of two molds:  "Developer" or "Business Guy".<p>"Developer" should have extensive experience programming in Java and Groovy and experience with Grails, as well as considerable indepth experience with typical components of the Java enterprise stack:  Spring, Hibernate, JBoss, Tomcat, etc.  Strong knowledge of SQL and one or more relational databases (preferably PostgreSQL) would be needed.  Strongly preferred would be some experience with machine learning, text mining, social network analysis, enterprise integration, data mining, etc.  Experience contributing to Open Source projects is a huge plus.<p>"Business Guy (or Gal!)" would have would ideally have experience in marketing, product management and/or sales, in the enterprise software world.  Knowledge of the Customer Development process would be preferred, as well as experience with at least one well known sales methodology such as Solution Selling.  Actual sales closing experience would be a HUGE plus here, but isn't absolutely required.  Experience developing partnerships, working with industry analysis,  and any PR knowledge would also be highly valued.  If you speak terms like "differentiation" and "positioning" and read Jack Trout and Al Ries  books for leisure, you're our kind of gnarly dude / dudette.<p>Anybody we would add to the founding team at this point would need to live in the Chapel Hill, Raleigh, Durham area.<p>Email Phil at prhodes (at) fogbeam (dot) com for more info.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5475806 href="vote?for=5475806_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%34%37%32%37%34%36"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5475806></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=craigmccaskill">craigmccaskill</a> 61 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5475806">link</a></span></div><br>

Contribute all up and down the stack, from JavaScript and Python to C and shell scripting, from traditional MVC web development down to TCP/IP, DNS and iptables.<p>* Autodidactic. Learning is fun. Prepare to do a lot of it. We have way more components than team members and we intend to keep it that way.<p>* Autonomous. Be comfortable working with minimal oversight. We don’t have any PMs and we don’t plan to hire any for quite some time. Downside: you don’t get a spec. Upside: you don’t get a spec.<p>* Product-focused.

You know when to git merge and when to git rebase, and it makes a difference (nobody likes a messy commit history). Your code feels obvious in retrospect. You take pride in your work.<p>* Test-Friendly.

Verba helps college bookstores transform themselves so that they a) understand and embrace the power of the nets, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make a healthy profit.<p>About 300 colleges and universities use our applications to acquire low-cost inventory and price textbooks competitively.

This is a good business to be in: the amount of data is only increasing, lawyers are willing to pay for better solutions, and we're good at applying cutting-edge CS to traditionally hard problems. As a result, we're cash-flow positive less than two years after our founding, and growing rapidly.<p>We have many challenging problems, including machine learning, visualization, search, and nifty user interfaces. We're looking for generalists; we'll teach you (or you'll teach yourself) what you need to know.<p>We're a fun company, with an awesome location in downtown Berkeley, foosball, game nights, and more.

Good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is a must, and a good eye for design is a nice bonus. We support only modern browsers (no IE6 headaches), so we have a very rich HTML/Javascript interface that relies on AJAX queries to pull down data and perform much of the work.<p>Software Engineer - We all wear many hats, contributing to a backend Java codebase that uses minimal XML. We use a lot of modern open source technologies: Lucene, Cassandra, AWS, etc. We have a separate Python codebase for performing offline work. We strive to write all of our code in a modular, reusable style that maximizes code-sharing and minimizes repetition. We schedule weekly time for refactoring so that we avoid the accumulation of technical debt. If you're sharp and you're interested in learning how to write performant code that uses modern academic research and operates on the latest infrastructure, you'll like this role.<p>Systems Engineer - We deal with many terabytes of data. We have our own 48-drive-bay fileserver to handle our expanding storage needs over the next couple years. We need someone with Unix experience who is comfortable in Python to help us work more efficiently. You'll manage our AWS installations, manage our internal systems, and help make our entire setup more robust.

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We’re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we’re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.<p>We recently secured a new round of funding, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5472834 href="vote?for=5472834_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%34%37%32%37%34%36"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5472834></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=transmit101">transmit101</a> 62 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5472834">link</a></span></div><br>

But also, you'll be working with the whole mobile team, composed of 13 other cool, brilliant, motivated people: Android/BlackBerry devs, backend devs, marketing, design, product people, one technical lead and a chief mobile officer.<p>From a technological perspective, we work with Objective-C, the different iOS frameworks, and we use Git/GitHub as our source code management system. We're keen on working fast, in an agile/SCRUM manner. We're keeping the concept of working like a "start-up within a start-up" and we're looking for another developer to join us and help us build the next versions of the Viadeo app.<p>About you:<p>You should have some previous experience in working with iOS, know your way around Core Data, be comfortable with Cocoa Touch (or at least be able to pick up its different aspects), understand the MVC pattern and apply it as much as possible in your projects. Speaking of which, it would be great if you have something we can look at, either previous projects or previous code. It would be awesome if you have a GitHub account. Also if you know and use Git.<p>Other than that, work well with others, be motivated and cool, cause you'll be joining a cool and motivated team.<p>About Viadeo:<p>You'll be working in a fast-growing, competitive, international company, in the field of professional social networking, which still has the spirit of a start-up. Go to <a href="http://corporate.viadeo.com/en/about-us/group-facts/" rel="nofollow">http://corporate.viadeo.com/en/about-us/group-facts/</a> for more info.

Check out viadeo.com for our website.<p>Did I mention we get a cooked lunch served at the company cantine every day, with a salad bar and Nutella chocolate cake desert (or fruit salad for the health conscious)? Also, free drinks, coffee and tea.<p>Get in touch with me if you have more questions or are interested in this position (also attach your CV): apatru [at] viadeoteam [dot] com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5473897 href="vote?for=5473897_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%34%37%32%37%34%36"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5473897></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=x2Opteron">x2Opteron</a> 62 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5473897">link</a></span></div><br>

The number of businesses using OpenStack in general and Swift in particular grows and grows, and it includes big names that make products that are used by both your little brother and your grandmother. You’ll work on a product that makes core OpenStack technology accessible to businesses of all kinds.<p>You’ll get open-source experience in a big way. At SwiftStack, we’re committed to strong participation in the OpenStack ecosystem in general and to contribution to Swift in particular. You’ll be a contributor to one of the most important Open Source projects currently active.<p>You’ll confront interesting problems every day. Writing a system like Swift and building a software ecosystem to surround it is the road less traveled. We aren’t writing yet another glorified CMS or social app or phone game. Whether it’s figuring out better algorithms for data placement, confronting a firehose of monitoring data, or determining how to integrate most flexibly with customers’ systems, there are always new and unusual problems to solve.<p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done. Tell us in a few lines of text why you’re interested in SwiftStack, and why we’ll be interested in you. We’ll be back in touch shortly to get the conversation started.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5472883 href="vote?for=5472883_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%34%37%32%37%34%36"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5472883></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=benhedrington">benhedrington</a> 62 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5472883">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Diego, CA<p>We are hiring an onboarding director for our company. Our need is for an organized self-starter that is fairly technical to take over the onboarding and project-direction for new customers of our platform. You'll also be dealing with product development, learning how our infrastructure works and coming up with ideas to increase customer happiness. We always hire with upward mobility in mind; do a great job and we will make sure you benefit from it.<p>We're a small startup of 4 people, well-funded and growing rapidly located in downtown San Diego. Our software platform is in the ad-tech space, but we also deal with hardware, large scale data processing and crap-tons of other bleeding-edge tech. We have a flexible-time _#38; vacation policy with fantastic benefits (one hell of a cadillac health plan). Our two rules are: get shit done and be here for the morning meeting each day.<p>This is a job that rewards people that can improvise and have a relentless attitude towards quality. There is no frying pan in our business, only a fire - but we give you a hell of a flameproof suit and reward accordingly for your effort.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5474856 href="vote?for=5474856_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%72%54%37%46%39%72%4a%6d%4c%71%48%4c%64%51%77%57%30%33%4b%71%74%74"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5474856></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wcassis">wcassis</a> 62 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5474856">link</a></span></div><br>

We have everything from server level monitoring/control agents to protocol proxies to backend metrics systems that need love.<p><i>Operations/devops</i> - If you have used chef/puppet or similar, get irritated about "snowflakes" (one off servers), and have a sometimes irrational desire to automate everything, you are someone we want to talk to. We are one of the companies where operations is the product, so work on the backend systems will often make its way in front of users.<p>[Whatever you do well] - If you have some combination of skills that you think we need, let us know why we should be thinking about them.<p>----------------------------------------------<p>Our tech "stack" is largely node.js/Ruby/Mongo/Redis (and now Erlang), we've experimented with various languages and other databases. We generally believe in using the right tool for a give job. If you want to tackle a particular problem with OCaml, for instance, you probably won't face much friction.<p>We have an office right next to the Caltrain in San Mateo (15 mi south of SF) and are willing to let people work remotely if they can do it well. We will also cover relocation for good people. Our priority is "people who get things done, sometimes in anger" and almost everything else is negotiable.<p>If you're interested, email hello@mongohq.com and ask us some questions (or tell us a story).

As our first hire and only front-end specialist, you'll drive the function and feel of our UI, creating entirely new ways of interacting with data. You’ll meet weekly with the designer of the TiVo UI (an advisor of ours) to sketch out solutions to extremely challenging usability problems, which you'll then implement. You'll code in HTML, CSS/LESS, Ruby, and Coffeescript, using Bootstrap, Backbone, Underscore, jQuery, and d3. And as the first hire, you’ll earn significant equity and help shape our culture.<p>The ideal candidate:
. Excited about taking responsibility and ownership over big pieces of the product
. Comfortable with UI and UX challenges. Graphic design skills are a bonus (we currently have none).
. Interested in data analysis.
. An extremely talented programmer, skilled with front end tools like HTML, CSS, and Javascript/Coffeescript. 
. Familiarity with the other tools listed above is a bonus.
. Deeply concerned with system reliability, code quality, and front end architecture.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, Full Time, H1B is OK<p>Betable is hiring awesome software engineers.<p>About Us<p>Betable engineering is an elite team of hardworking dreamers and tinkerers. We’re pragmatic, but we don’t let that interfere with our perfectionism. We’re fluent in computing concepts from anonymous memory management to monadic zeros.<p>We’re building a platform. Engineering innovation is our competitive advantage. We’re doing something new and different in an industry that hasn’t seen any real innovation in the last century. That excites us.<p>We try to be technology agnostic, preferring suitability to ideology. Our services are small and chatty, communicating through well-defined interfaces. Sometimes we compose them in ways that are surprising even to us. We think that’s healthy for a platform company. In general, we believe that sound system architecture and design are more important than any particular technology.<p>Day to day we use Node.js, Cassandra, Jenkins, Go, Java, Puppet, and GitHub. We like continuous integration. In fact, we like most forms of process automation. Sometimes our tools make us happy, sometimes they make us sad. When they make us sad, we make them better.<p>We like to work. We love to play. We don’t consider these activities mutually exclusive.<p>There aren’t many of us. We’re looking for more.<p>About You<p>You’re an engineering powerhouse who wants to work on challenging problems with a group of equally amazing colleagues. Your depth of knowledge in many areas of computing should qualify you as a specialist, but your breadth of expertise demands that you describe yourself as a generalist. Sometimes you think the two aren’t so different, but you resist that sort of reductionism.<p>You’re well rounded. You have hobbies that don’t involve computers. Despite your expertise, you sometimes surprise casual acquaintances with your profession. You can’t carry a tune but you sing anyways. Your recreational reading includes works by  Kurt Vonnegut, W. Richard Stevens, and Dr. Seuss.<p>You’re not sure whether P equals NP, but the possibility leaves you feeling both titillated and terrified. Sometimes, while considering the repercussions, you lose composure.<p>Mutable state is your frenemy. You appreciate what Scala has managed to do on the JVM. You’ve developed several profiles of the language, each Turing complete. You’re curious about the future of Go. You’ve toyed with several syntactic variants of your own competing language based on the π-calculus. You’re an expert at SQL, but would never describe yourself that way.<p>You had a check for $2.56 from Donald Knuth. You cashed it when your bank started displaying digitized check scans in your transaction history because you hate physical media.<p>You can explain technical concepts to non-technical people. Non-technical people enjoy the experience. At parties your conversations transition seamlessly from Emacs vs. vi to Beatles vs. Stones.<p>You consider coding a craft – as much art as science. It’s your creative outlet. You consider quines a form of poetry. You often describe code as beautiful.<p>You’re self aware. Some of these statements don’t apply to you, but you can read between the lines. Others upset you. You understand why at a fundamental level. You can argue your position, and you can win.<p>Sound like you? Join us.<p><a href="http://betable.theresumator.com/apply/KYLS0t/Software-Engineer.html" rel="nofollow">http://betable.theresumator.com/apply/KYLS0t/Software-Engine...</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5475861 href="vote?for=5475861_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%72%54%37%46%39%72%4a%6d%4c%71%48%4c%64%51%77%57%30%33%4b%71%74%74"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5475861></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=andrewroycarter">andrewroycarter</a> 61 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5475861">link</a></span></div><br>

Maybe you're one of the few that think they're merely AWESOME.<p>If you've answered yes to a few of the above questions, we'd love to talk to you.  To be successful at this job you will have exceptional JavaScript skills, a friendly personality and the ability to work in collaboration with other developers and our clients.<p>Do any of these apply to you as well?<p>You've built something cool using Backbone.js, AngularJS, or some other   client-side MV* framework. 
Know HTML(5) and CSS(3) inside and out. 
You know Less, SASS or some other CSS preprocessor. Maybe you've even built your   own toolkit that sits on top of your preprocessor of choice. 
You've worked with at least one high-level server-side language. 
You can clearly articulate why "responsive design" isn't a panacea. 
You appreciate being called a hacker. 
You love the web. 
You really love mobile devices.<p>The WillowTree Apps’ office is a fun, exciting place to work.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Software Engineers in Boston area (Waltham, MA)<p>Actifio (<a href="http://www.actifio.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.actifio.com</a>) is looking for software engineers. Actifio is radically simple copy data management. We've invented some really cool technology to do things no other system can, and we're dead easy to use. This is not your mother's enterprise software!<p>Actifio has been invested in by top VC firms (one of the very few East Coast companies in Andreessen Horowitz's portfolio) and is growing super fast. Recently, we closed a 50 million dollar round of funding.<p>We're always looking for smart engineers in every team, but since I'm on the deduplication team, I'll have to pitch you on that :) Briefly, our other teams include Java, C++, and Adobe Air, and work on things like VMware interaction, snapshot management, scheduling, databases, etc.<p>As for the dedup team: we write in C, and use Python for debugging and support scripts. Dedup seems like an easy problem to solve, because it's so conceptually simple: split the data up into blocks and make sure you only store one of each. But at scale, it becomes a whole different animal.
When you've got 128TB of 4KB blocks, you have 32 billion unique blocks of data to manage. Making our dedup ingest, restore, and garbage collect fast is a great challenge, especially with "only" 128 GB of RAM.<p>If you'd like to chat about a job opportunity (in dedup or otherwise!), I'm at chris.murphy@actifio.com. Since I'm an engineer, I'm not going to type a list of silly requirements. Just send me a resume and whatever else you think I'd like to know.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5473787 href="vote?for=5473787_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%72%54%37%46%39%72%4a%6d%4c%71%48%4c%64%51%77%57%30%33%4b%71%74%74"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5473787></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=russell_h">russell_h</a> 62 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5473787">link</a></span></div><br>

Many customers are huge brand name apps you would recognize (10M+ users each).  That's a lot of devices we push data to, and it's a lot of data coming back when devices phone home (analytics data, location data, etc.).  Our engineering targets for push are 100,000 messages sent per second or more.  It's interesting because a lot of our traffic is outbound (us sending things to phones) as well as inbound (phones calling back to us).  It's kind of crazy, we have to make sure we don't DDOS ourselves and our customers.<p>I work on Audience Segmentation.  Customers can slice and dice who they want to send to.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>BERLIN/GERMANY, NODE.JS/JAVASCRIPT, FULL-TIME, LOCATED IN THE FACTORY NEXT TO GOOGLE, SOUNDCLOUD _#38; MOZILLA<p>Top 5 reasons why you should move to Berlin, now:<p>1. Lowest livings costs with highest standard of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun + we have Car2Go and Drive-Now (these are world's best smartphone-supported car sharing systems with brand new cars at every corner, cheaper than owning a car or riding a cab). In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird, Mozilla and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one.<p>5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.<p>Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, we’d love to talk with you. If you don't live in Berlin yet, we could help to fix that.<p>=_#62; <a href="http://urge.io/jobs" rel="nofollow">http://urge.io/jobs</a><p>If you are doing Node.js or JS, apply today—we are looking for multiple Node.js Software Engineers.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5472917 href="vote?for=5472917_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%72%54%37%46%39%72%4a%6d%4c%71%48%4c%64%51%77%57%30%33%4b%71%74%74"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5472917></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=joshmlewis">joshmlewis</a> 62 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5472917">link</a></span></div><br>

It’s clever technology is helping successful businesses to stay on top of their ever growing number of customer and contact relationships in a social world. Instead of company data being scattered across multiple applications and employees wasting time on searching for the right pieces of customer info, Unifyo provides instant access to unified customer profiles, without any complex setup or integration work. Less time spent on searching, more time spent on business.<p>We are adding two people to our team of 7:<p>1) Online Marketing / Growth hacking – responsible for user acquisition and overall growth. If you have great communication skills, you love to experiment with user acquisition techniques and you are into measuring what works and what doesn't, then we'd love to hear from you.<p>2) Sales / Customer Success – convert users to paying customers. The likes of Yammer and other "free to sign up" services didn't scale by simply cold-calling companies, but by making sure that people and companies which did sign up got the most out of their products, converted into paying customers and made sure every employee is using their products. Little cold-calling but lots of selling by making sure our users use Unifyo successfully - if that sounds like a plan to you, get in touch.<p>We’re a small, fun team, with an emphasis on enjoying our work and learning. We are a Seedcamp funded company (Europe's biggest startup accelerator), so you'll have access to a huge mentor network.

It's a "level 3" engineer job- you'd be taking escalations from the 1st and 2nd tier techs when they weren't able to solve problems themselves; mentoring them on skills they should know; advising clients on the best ways to improve their infrastructure, and implementing solutions to some fun projects (getting those 8 dusty old DL 320's out of someone's rack and onto their very first VMware deployment!)<p>The right candidate will need 3+ years of experience in a helpdesk or service delivery environment; proven skills with Windows servers from 03-08, including Active Directory, Exchange, DNS, DFS, WDS would be cool.. and experience with multiple server environments. Know what a firewall is too- Sonicwall experience would be great!<p>Be a good communicator, superior troubleshooter, able to work under pressure, and really want to be part of a team.
I'd love to talk to you more about it if you're interested! Send your resume to ndespres@cmitsolutions.com and let's chat.<p>www.cmitsolutions.com/grandcentral

Now do that for every page view and API call and in such a way that it can scale to thousands of clients. And this needs to be presented in a way the user understands in 25 different languages (including right-to-left), multiple currencies, multiple time zones and needs to look good on a variety of devices.<p>As can be expected in a nascent billion dollar market there are many competitors, but unlike many other markets the usability and the quality of the algorithms make a big difference to business success. This means a great programmer can get the respect he deserves here: Above average salary, equity options, pick your own equipment, extremely flexible working hours. SuperSaaS is still tiny but has been consistently profitable since going live 5 years ago, while enjoying triple digit growth rates.<p>Interested?

Our product domain is web-based enterprise applications for regulated industries.  We are growing rapidly and gaining market share.  We write web-based software that provides our clients with powerful and intuitive tools to manage their documents.<p>Our engineering team is diverse and senior-heavy - we have a few startup veterans, a Haskell guy, some people who like speaking at conferences and meetups, and even some game developers. We used AJAX before it was called AJAX.  The engineering “managers” aren’t really managers - they’re the ones who architected the products and lead their maintenance.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Nashville, TN: Software Developer<p>An Open Letter<p>My name is Tim Martin. I own this company with one other person, Mike Rustici. We hire exceptional software developers.<p>You want to work here. If you’re a great software developer, you really want to work here.<p>We value life outside of the office. People who work here don’t work more than 40 hour weeks. Seriously, we don’t let them. We don’t have a vacation policy. If you are the kind of person for whom we have to count vacation days, you’re not the right person. Take care of your work, take time off and live your life. I have no idea how many days off any of our employees took last year. Because they get their work done and done well, I just don’t care.<p>You want to work here. I wear a t-shirt to work everyday. Mike wears a collar, but we make fun of him for it. I play ping pong every day because the title of “King of the Table” is important. I care about our Office Mom’s bird Ripley because she cares about it.<p>You want to work here, because you’re good. We often dole out projects with a 10 minute conversation and a month to make it go. Show us that you’re good, and we’ll trust you to decide how something should work and when you’re going to do it. If you are uncomfortable learning new things and working through stuff yourself, you probably don’t want to work here.<p>You want to work here, because we're good. Check out the our website to see that (scorm.com). We recently invented the Tin Can API which is spreading like wildfire and reinventing our industry (tincanapi.com).<p>We're a small company with big-time clients and potential to match (I'm posting particular job ad from the Googleplex). You've probably never heard of us and you've probably never worked with us, but the people who have hold us in the highest esteem. If you're going to apply, make sure you know what we do. We are at the very center of the e-learning industry and we're always evolving our products and creating new ones.<p>Skills _#38; Requirements<p>Mike and I are both former developers who didn’t like working for people who didn’t value our work. We won’t forget that. We also didn’t like working with people who couldn’t keep up.<p>We want depth of development skill, but particular languages are not crucial. Depth in Java or .NET would be a good place to start and experience with the LAMP stack or Python might come in handy. We’re not hung up on a particular amount of experience, but we are adamant about a particular level of skill.<p>In this particular role, excellent communictation and a desire to work with people will be important (yes, real live people...but at least they're other developers). We are looking for somebody who can help our clients integrate our products, but also get down and dirty in coding those products.<p>About Rustici Software<p>Rustici Software creates products that simplify conforming with e-learning standards like SCORM and AICC. We recently invented the next generation of these standards that an entire industry is rallying around. What does that mean? Read our website for the technical details. At a high level, we found a niche solving a deceptively complicated problem in a growing industry. We're the only company in the world that does what we do and we're beloved by the people in that industry. We're also been repeatedly named one of Nashville's fastest growing companies and best places to work.<p>How to apply<p>Each time we hire, we wait until we find exactly the right person. If that’s you, we really hope you’ll send your resume over to us with an email.<p>Make sure that what we get from you makes it painfully apparent that you are the right person. Make sure that you make it clear in your email or resume or whatever, that this job is important to you, that you want to work here, not just somewhere.<p>You will want to spend some time on our website, learn how we think and what we do. Get to know us if you want us to get to know you.<p>Submissions should be made to jobs@scorm.com.<p>One of the first things we’ll have you do in the selection process is complete a small programming test. If you’d care to submit it with your initial application, it certainly won’t hurt. We have intentionally kept it simple in an effort to value your time. But we can tell a lot from your response. Consider it carefully. You can download the test from scorm.com/wp-content/assets/jobs/EmployeeTest.zip.

We're also considering languages particularly well-suited for metaprogramming as we build out our developer tooling (e.g. Clojure _#38; ClojureScript).<p>Apply for jobs via AngelList, <a href="https://angel.co/famo-us#recruiting" rel="nofollow">https://angel.co/famo-us#recruiting</a> , or email tyler@famo.us</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5473344 href="vote?for=5473344_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4a%73%68%31%55%78%45%69%32%4b%75%32%70%46%5a%36%44%63%32%68%6c%66"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5473344></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=xtracto">xtracto</a> 62 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5473344">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Wello: SF or REMOTE fulltime (near pacific time)<p>At Wello (<a href="https://www.wello.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.wello.com</a>), we are rethinking how people get fit. Gyms do not work for 89% of Americans, but yet they are a $21B industry thanks to recurring fees. We are trying to change that by bringing the Gym to your home over live video and thus eliminating waste. If the country gets a little more fitter using our platform, thats all the more good.<p>We want you to come help us engineer this transition. We are doing what AirBnb, Uber and others did with excess capacity in their markets to fitness professional market.<p>Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We just recently launched Group workouts. We just graduated from Rock Health and have some great investors who get marketplaces like us. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide.<p>We use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. No one has yet got a six-pack but we could probably all run long distances comfortably. We are a small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. Almost all of us have worked at other companies before so while we dont have nerf guns, we still know how to have fun.<p>Our technical stack is Python/Django and MySQL. We also use Fabric, NGinx, Apache, Celery, Redis and RabbitMQ. We also use services like CircleCI, Optimizely, MixPanel, SegmentIO and Asana for getting things done.<p>Contact us at dev@wello.co.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5473816 href="vote?for=5473816_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4a%73%68%31%55%78%45%69%32%4b%75%32%70%46%5a%36%44%63%32%68%6c%66"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5473816></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=daigoba66">daigoba66</a> 62 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5473816">link</a></span></div><br>

We mostly focus on field organizing, fundraising, and online organizing, but if you've got a good idea about how to effect progressive change through technology, we have pretty solid market penetration for scaling it.<p>Our biggest apps are in .NET (one webforms/ADO, one MVC/EF, both up to date framework-wise), but we also work on Drupal sites, our iOS and Android apps, newer node.js services, and js clients that keep getting thicker, but in a good way.<p>More info at <a href="http://www.ngpvan.com/about/jobs/senior-developers" rel="nofollow">http://www.ngpvan.com/about/jobs/senior-developers</a> - I know this has a jobs@ngpvan.com email, but I swear real people including me read everything that comes in.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5472966 href="vote?for=5472966_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4a%73%68%31%55%78%45%69%32%4b%75%32%70%46%5a%36%44%63%32%68%6c%66"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5472966></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=miles_matthias">miles_matthias</a> 62 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5472966">link</a></span></div><br>

So you don’t need to know Rails or iOS but you do need to have experience in familiar frameworks, and you need to be willing to learn either or both. Languages and frameworks can be learned, passion cannot.<p>Our development process is based on XP with an emphasis on individualism and pragmatism. We pair a lot, but not all the time. We test a lot, but not all the time. The key is being able to explain your practices with rational argument.

We offer competitive salaries with flexible hours. Experience with some parts of the Adobe toolchain is necessary.

Successful business owners seeking a full-time Rails developer with strong back-end coding and testing skills to join our development team for a new business venture.<p>We are looking for someone who:
- Has experience building and deploying production applications in Rails 3.
- Confidently embraces unit testing and integration testing in daily work.
- Considers application architecture and refactors regularly to that end.<p>You might be the right fit if:
- You Love Ruby and have significant experience with Rails.
- You know your way around RSpec and/or MiniTest, and can converse knowledgeably on the pros/cons
 of TDD.
- You've heard of Turnip and Spinach and know how they differ from Cucumber.
- You're not afraid to write raw SQL.
- You can explain HABTM vs HMT.
- You're comfortable with git, branches, merges, etc.
- You know your way around a Linux server, and have a notion of how you might deploy a Rails application from start to finish without using Heroku.
- You understand that "skinny controllers, fat models" is only a partial solution, and you can name several ways
 to keep a growing Rails application object-oriented while preventing the models from becoming jumbled bags of methods.
- You understand the concept of writing some unit tests without Rails as a dependency.
- You've at least thought about ways to treat Rails as the delivery mechanism rather than as the application, and you are open to exploring this further.<p>We are open to flexible work arrangements and you will be part of a team that includes a designer, a front-end developer and another Rails expert.

There are no marketers standing over you with bullwhips _#38; chairs demanding the impossible and no mushroom management. There is good coffee, a nice office, an openness to new ideas, and a strong work/life balance.<p>For more details _#38; to apply, there's a more traditional job advert on Stack Overflow: <a href="http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/30634/healthcare-startup-seeking-web-app-developer-dred-com?a=Ac0JAxq_#38;searchTerm=dred" rel="nofollow">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/30634/healthcare-start...</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5475628 href="vote?for=5475628_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%34%45%4b%6b%39%68%46%42%74%4e%33%4e%31%33%49%6a%32%59%4a%41%50%43"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5475628></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rlei">rlei</a> 61 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5475628">link</a></span></div><br>
