<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Transcriptic: Core Developer<p>Menlo Park, CA<p>Transcriptic is the "Amazon Web Services" for life sciences. Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic's central, highly automated 'biocenter' in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We're building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>We're looking for highly talented full-stack web developers as well as combined background EE/CS engineers for automation integration and development. Experience reverse engineering USB based protocols is a plus.<p>We're a very small startup (you'd be #4), but well funded and have customers. You'd be able to work on interesting science and hard technology in a really small, all technical team with lots of freedom and resources.<p>A biology background is preferred but not strictly necessary for outstanding people. The codebase is mostly Ruby and Scala, with some Python.<p>max at transcriptic.com<p><a href="https://www.transcriptic.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.transcriptic.com/</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5306826 href="vote?for=5306826_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%33%30%34%31%36%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5306826></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=habosa">habosa</a> 92 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5306826">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Buffer (<a href="http://bufferapp.com" rel="nofollow">http://bufferapp.com</a>) - Anywhere in the world (we're a distributed team of 10 people in the US, UK, Hong Kong and Sydney).<p>I'd love for you to come join Buffer for the fun ride. We have over 500,000 users and are on a $1M+ annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead, as we are looking to hit the millions of users in 2013.<p>We've consistently grown 15% MoM for the last year and are expecting even faster growth in the coming months through our mobile efforts. That's where we are in need of some help.<p><pre><code>    So, we're looking for an Android Developer to work on our app.
    This includes taking over most of the work of the app which has
    70,000 downloads and more in the Kindle and Blackberry stores too.
    If you've worked with Android before, that's great. If you're a great
    hacker and have developed in Java or other mobile platforms that's
    awesome also.
</code></pre>
If you're interested in coming on board, you will:<p><pre><code>    - work primarily with myself and Sunil, who has lead development
      so far and is now taking a more general tech role
    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great
      approach in dealing with others
    - be a Buffer user (would be awesome, it’s cool if not)
    - be friendly and comfortable helping our users
    - be anywhere in the world, and if you'd like, you have help and
      support from us to move to where you want to be
    - have experience working with another startup before (would
      be awesome, it’s cool if not)
</code></pre>
One of our core values at Buffer is to "Default to transparency". I've told you above how many users we have, and our revenues. We raised $450k from awesome investors, and we are cash-flow positive. Within the team, there is even more transparency. We have an Open Salary policy where everyone knows how much everyone else makes.<p>Another key value we have is to "Have a focus on self improvement". The thing that we do which I don't know that any other startups do, is that we have a daily 'standup' Google Hangout between pairs of people in the team (the pairs cycle each 2 weeks). As part of the call we share a daily improvement. Something we're working on to improve ourselves. It can be related to Buffer, but usually it isn't. Some examples of improvements people have worked on: start blogging every 2 weeks, speak at first event, speak to a new person every day, wake up an hour earlier. We all encourage each other with our improvements, and this helps us push forward much faster than otherwise. It's a really positive environment and there is built in accountability. Everyone here seems to progress at an incredible pace, we want to do everything to make that happen for you as well. Whether you want to start speaking, blogging, learning marketing or have other areas of personal growth, you’ll have my personal support and the whole team as a resource too.<p>If you're interested in all our values, you can take a look at them here: <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/joelg2/buffer-culture-01-16707113" rel="nofollow">http://www.slideshare.net/joelg2/buffer-culture-01-16707113</a><p>Since we have Open Salaries at Buffer, I can tell you right now that your salary will be between $88k and $110k depending on your location (living costs) and experience. You will also get equity in the 0.5-1.5% range.<p>If this sounds fun, let's have a chat. I'm looking forward to it!

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Austin, TX; NYC; Boston; or Remote - Front end Python web dev, and UI/UX designer for a Python data analytics startup<p>Continuum Analytics (<a href="http://continuum.io" rel="nofollow">http://continuum.io</a>) is building a Python-based advanced analytics platform in the browser, named Wakari (<a href="http://wakari.io" rel="nofollow">http://wakari.io</a>).  We have a solid team that's put together a great product, but we need a few more great people to help us really make this thing shine.<p>The front-end web developer position is going to mostly help us build out the most cutting-edge data visualization and dashboarding UIs, as well as be a general JS/HTML/CSS guru. Some knowledge of the backend stack (especially in Python) would be great, and there is a good chance that we'll be targeting tablets and mobile HTML designs down the road.<p>The UI/UX designer will not just help us develop refined workflows throughout the entire application, but will also be heavily involved in discussions about novel data analysis and data viz interfaces.  They will also be leaned upon to help us with print design, for marketing collateral.  We are also involved with a number of other open-source efforts, all of which can use some more design expertise for their web properties.<p>Continuum Analytics is building some of the coolest backend tools for Python in Big Data and high-performance computing.  We recently made some waves by winning a $3 mil contract from DARPA to build out a Python to x86/GPU compiler (<a href="http://numba.pydata.org" rel="nofollow">http://numba.pydata.org</a>), a distributed array/tabular processing system (<a href="http://blaze.pydata.org" rel="nofollow">http://blaze.pydata.org</a>), and a next-generation interactive graphing engine for JavaScript + Python (<a href="http://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh" rel="nofollow">http://github.com/ContinuumIO/bokeh</a>).<p>We are a very young startup based in sunny Austin, TX, but with many devs working remotely.  We have full benefits and have a very distributed workflow/infrastructure, relying on distributed collaboration tools.<p>Our founders are both technical but have a lot of business experience in the advanced analytics space.  Our team is absolutely world-class, consisting of authors and contributors to core Scientific Python / PyData packages like NumPy, Scipy, PyTables, Cython, Chaco, and others.  We are only a year old, but we are growing quickly and our products are gaining a lot of traction.<p>Email jobs@continuum.io and come join our team!<p>If you are going to be at PyCon in a few weeks, come by our booth and learn more about the company!  If you are going to be in Austin for SXSW, we'll be at the Door64 Startup Showcase on Friday March 8th, and we're one of the sponsors of the Austin Data Party on Sunday March 10th, so come see us then!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5307206 href="vote?for=5307206_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%33%30%34%31%36%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5307206></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=carterschonwald">carterschonwald</a> 92 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5307206">link</a></span></div><br>

Verba helps college bookstores transform themselves so that they a) understand and embrace the power of the nets, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make a healthy profit.<p>About 300 colleges and universities use our applications to acquire low-cost inventory and price textbooks competitively. Then millions of students visit our white-labeled sites to transparently compare the bookstore's offers against online competitors, and around 80% of students choose to buy from their local bookstore.<p>We're looking for people familiar with Ruby, Rails, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We (thankfully) don't have too many scaling problems on the technical side, but we have a ton of opportunities (product and partner-based) that we could move on much faster with a few more hands on deck, and we're always looking for ways to provide more control to our support team so they can provide top-notch customer service.<p>The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end.<p>Be sure to check out our website (<a href="http://www.verbasoftware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.verbasoftware.com</a>) so you can read all about our current products and hear people say nice things about us. :)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5305154 href="vote?for=5305154_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%33%30%34%31%36%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5305154></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=memset">memset</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5305154">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>NYC - Full Time, Intern - Python Developer, UX/UI Developer, Visual Designer for Brooklyn eyewear startup<p>We are Classic Specs, a startup which designs eyewear in Brooklyn, NY. We sell affordable frames ($89, frames+lenses). Our bigger business, however, is designing eyewear for fashion brands. We have a number of exciting brands in the pipeline and are growing our team to execute. If you are interested in fashion - and using technology to innovate in that space - then send me a note!<p>Our team is small, so we wear many hats. Our site is primarily in Python+Flask, with some PHP.<p>On the backend, we have written tools to manage customers' eyewear prescriptions, manage orders and inventory with our lens laboratory, and give our employees great tools for taking care of customers.<p>Since fashion relies on brand perception and recognition, we are looking for UX developers and designers who can understand a brand's aesthetic and create an eyewear website based around that. This will entail everything from a responsive website to, for graphic designers, print collateral that goes in the packages we ship to customers.<p>I am the first engineering hire, so you'd be an early employee on the team. We want folks who can help out on backend infrastructure tasks and help us grow as we take on new brands.<p>Finally, we are very much interested in hiring interns for the summer - we think you will learn a lot, and we will give you the chance to build some really cool things.<p>If this sounds interesting, email me! jay[[at]]classicspecs.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5305148 href="vote?for=5305148_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%33%30%34%31%36%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5305148></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=arohner">arohner</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5305148">link</a></span></div><br>

We're highly influenced by Valve's Employee handbook. SF-local employees have catered lunch every day.<p>The frontend is a fat javascript client, using HamlCoffee, Less and Knockout. We have a lot of interesting design and data-visualization problems that need to be solved, as well as A/B testing, landing page creation and funnel optimization.<p>The backend is written in Clojure. Backend engineers should know Clojure or another 'weird' language (Haskell, Scala, Scheme, etc), and Linux Devops (C compilation model, make, packaging).<p>Contact us at jobs@circleci.com.

These threads have literally become our primary hiring strategy ... they really work!!<p>We're looking for people who want to work with:<p>* Ruby on Rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)<p>* Javascript (we recently switched to Coffeescript and are loving it)<p>* iOS / Android<p>* Machine Learning / data mining / recommendations<p>* Back-end problems: scalability, web crawling, big data, analytics<p>* DevOps and web infrastructure<p>That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience. We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (we just built ourselves a rock-climbing wall!). We've got flexible hours, a very engineer-driven company culture, and a small but really terrific team.<p>We're working on a big new product launch now that we're really excited about. If you're interested in eBooks, I'd love to tell you about it.<p>Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire.<p>Generally we're looking for full-time and INTERN hires (junior year or older) who want to move to SF. H1B and relocation are no problem.  We're experts at getting people visas for the US.<p>See more at scribd.com/jobs and feel free to email me directly: jared at scribd.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5304376 href="vote?for=5304376_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%33%30%34%31%36%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5304376></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dhyasama">dhyasama</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5304376">link</a></span></div><br>

Fogbeam Labs.  <a href="http://www.fogbeam.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fogbeam.com</a><p>We are looking for sales people, to sell Open Source enterprise software.  We have some really cool products that live at the intersection of social-networking, business process management, collaboration/groupware and knowledge management.  Think "facebook for the enterprise" (ala Yammer or Jive) but with a much stronger focus on deep integration into business processes and workflows.<p>Experience doing enterprise sales is preferred, but if you've never sold a thing in your life and you're interested, apply anyway.  We'll train the right person(s).<p>And if you <i>really</i> have the right stuff, we'd consider granting you a significant chunk of equity and bringing you in as a co-founder.  In any case, since this is a startup, there is a ton of opportunity to grow and help us build an empire.  Our first salesperson could easily wind up VP of Sales or Chief Marketing Officer or something down the road (if they are interested, of course).<p>We're also open to adding another technical person to the co-founding team.  The right person would need some seriously strong technical chops, with a background in the JVM world, preferably with some or all of:<p>serious Groovy/Grails experience, strong knowledge of various persistence mechanisms (relational databases, graph databases, document databases, etc), experience with Lucene, Mahout, jBPM, Activiti, Camel, Jena, Solr, and/or Hadoop.  Any experience with Machine Learning, NLP, Semantic Web technologies, and/or Social Network Analysis would be a big bonus.  A double extra super bonus would be any experience or background as a business analyst or similar role.  Front end development skills would be a positive as well, but isn't required (one of the current co-founders (not me) is a bad-ass front-end designer).<p>So, if you're interested in joining the next great Open Source enterprise software company, working on Open Source projects full-time (and we mean REAL Open Source, developed in the open, collaboratively, ASLv2 licensed, etc), working on hard problems with Machine Learning, NLP, Information Retrieval, Social Network Analysis, and "big data" tools, get in touch.  We have an obsessive focus on solving real problems and creating real value, in exchange for real money.  This isn't some speculative "hey, let's build a great site for sharing photos of cats doing silly things and figure out how to monetize it when we have a billion users" deal.<p>We can't pay any relocation expenses at the moment, so local folks only, please.

We use Chef to administer our systems on AWS, build and deploy using Travis-CI, and monitor using DataDog (a pretty cool startup based around statsd).<p>Performance and scalability are our two primary concerns, and with the traffic and growth rates that we're experiencing, lots of the lessons that you've learned start to break down. Because of that, it's not as important what you know right now – what matters is how quickly you can learn and adapt.<p><pre><code>  * Your work will have an immediate and profound impact on our product and business.
  * We ship code dozens of times a week, and you will write code and push to production on your first day.
  * You will be responsible for making important decisions about what tools and libraries we use.
  * You will have a direct role in building the team, helping us choose additional team members as we grow in size.
  * We prize open source contribution. You should have a GitHub account already.
  * Everyone gets equity. We want a team of partners.
  * Unlimited vacation. We work hard, but at a sustainable pace.
  * Flexible work schedule, including working at home part-time if you want.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>(Throwaway because I do not want to reveal my identity)<p>I'm sure not all of you guys are like this but I applied for the Graduate R_#38;D Financial Software Development Engineer program a couple months back in your London office and the telephone interview went great but the face-to-face interviews were an absolute farce.<p>Prior to the face to face interviews, I confirmed Java as my language of choice (simply because I knew my C knowledge was little and wasn't up to scratch at the time and was told that Java would be absolutely fine for the interview) but the first pair of face to face interviewers insisted on C based questions (i'd only had a little bit of C experience) which was nerve wracking.<p>The icing on the cake was during my second face to face interview session on the same day, whilst answering the primary programming question, my interviewer decided it would be more appropriate to check his work email on his phone rather than listen to me talk and go through the problem (again in C where I tripped up slightly on malloc'ing memory but managed to solve with a bit of umming and ahhing in the end). It wasn't even a quick glance, he spent most of the time I took to work on the problem checking his email. I'm still not sure what to make of this because personally to me this was probably the most unprofessional/rudest thing that's ever happened to me at an interview. I wouldn't even dare to pull out my phone during an interview and I expect the interviewer to have the same courtesy unless it's an emergency.<p>It was a decent experience and your offices (at least in London) are lovely but if you are looking for C/C++ specific graduate developers/engineers then that should've been made clear.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5306466 href="vote?for=5306466_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%33%30%34%31%36%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5306466></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=joubert">joubert</a> 92 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5306466">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>SF - full-time, Front End Engineer<p>About Statwing:<p>We love analyzing data. We love the feeling of getting an idea, exploring some hypotheses, and finding a surprising story in the data. And we love enabling others to have that feeling. That’s why we’re creating the modern data analysis tool, so anyone can get as much value out of their data as a trained expert, and much faster.<p>Most statistical analyses are conceptually simple, but they’re so dressed up in the arcane language of t-tests and p-values that they’re off limits to most humans, and painfully time-consuming for experts. Most people fall back to the much less powerful Excel (and its PivotTables), spending their time shuffling data around an interface that’s barely changed in 15 years. Statwing democratizes data analysis by making statistics easier to use and interpret than even Excel.<p>We’re two Stanford alums and we work in San Francisco’s Mission District, near the 16th and Mission BART stop. Our investors include Y Combinator, Jeff Hammerbacher (cofounded Cloudera, coined the term "Data Science", built the Facebook data team) and Jason Seats (cofounded Slicehost, runs TechStars Cloud).<p>About the job:<p>Radically improving the UI for data analysis is the core challenge of our company. As our first hire and only front-end specialist, you'll drive the function and feel of our UI, creating entirely new ways of interacting with data. You’ll meet weekly with the designer of the TiVo UI (an advisor of ours) to sketch out solutions to extremely challenging usability problems, which you'll then implement. You'll code in HTML, CSS/LESS, Ruby, and Coffeescript, using Bootstrap, Backbone, Underscore, jQuery, and d3. And as the first hire, you’ll earn significant equity and help shape our culture.<p>The ideal candidate:<p>Excited about taking responsibility and ownership over big pieces of the product<p>. Comfortable with UI and UX challenges. Graphic design skills are a bonus (we currently have none).<p>. Interested in data analysis.<p>. An extremely talented programmer, skilled with front end tools like HTML, CSS, and Javascript/Coffeescript.<p>. Familiarity with the other tools listed above is a bonus.
Deeply concerned with system reliability, code quality, and front end architecture.<p>. Open to asking for help, taking feedback, collaborating, and generally being a team player.<p>. Humor. Has a sense of it.<p>Email us at jobs@statwing.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5307975 href="vote?for=5307975_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%33%30%34%31%36%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5307975></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=doktrin">doktrin</a> 92 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5307975">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>MokaFive - Redwood City, CA (between San Francisco and Palo Alto), interns and H1Bs welcome, although it's somewhat late in the summer-internship cycle.<p>MokaFive makes life easier for large corporate IT departments who have too many computers to manage, and life better for end-users who would otherwise have to deal with a corporate IT department that's enforcing ridiculously restrictive policies for their own sanity. Our primary product, MokaFive Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into "layers", so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it's running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you're not on the LAN. There's a bunch of security stuff like full disk encryption and so forth.<p>I'm specifically looking for coworkers on my team, which works on experimental / future products. One product that's been seeing lots of growth is MokaFive BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into MokaFive Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don't have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We're also doing some work with MokaFive for iOS (and other platforms) to allow you to remotely access files on your desktop from your mobile device, and doing some work with remote filesystems as an outgrowth of that.<p>We're not per se a virtualization company: we don't write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems / virtualization, come talk to us. Our core product is in C++; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream. (If you're interested in making 2013 the year of Linux on the desktop, helping Windows shops continue to use Windows as a desktop but use Linux for drivers is an oddly great way to help bring that about -- we regularly work to improve Linux's hardware compatibility, since we have customers wanting to use a wide range of machines.)<p>See mokafive.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you're interested!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5306334 href="vote?for=5306334_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%33%30%34%31%36%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5306334></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zinxq">zinxq</a> 92 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5306334">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Refresh.io<p>Fulltime, Palo Alto  - funded Series A<p><a href="http://www.refresh.io" rel="nofollow">http://www.refresh.io</a><p>email: paul at refresh.io<p>Title: "Rather Impressive Java Developer"<p>Our current dev team is pretty awesome and we're looking to add to it. Currently we have a few PhD's, few ex-googler's, some tech book authors, couple of ex-linkedin, ex-microsofties, and stanfords, and a bunch of startup vets like Trulia and dealer.com. Heck we even have the guy who wrote the Java testing framework TestNG ( <a href="http://www.testng.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.testng.org</a> ) and the guy who wrote Mailinator ( <a href="http://mailinator.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://mailinator.blogspot.com</a> ). And we're only up to 6 people.  But we want a 7th and maybe 8th.<p>Job Description:  
Someone we want to work with. Someone who will make us smarter and better and, in return, someone we can make smarter and better too. Someone who will help us make our company and its products great.<p>Our technology includes: 
Java. Thousands of threads (Mailinator guy keeps adding more, TestNG guy keeps removing them). Tons of data, tremendous data analysis, fuzzy logic, machine learning, natural language processing. We use Mongo and we're having no problems with it - because we're careful. We treat every  superfluous database access and every unnecessary network call like its a small insult to our users. And gosh darn it, we love our users.<p>Simply, we are building a product that fetches and analyzes massive amounts of data to improve our user's lives (see the website for a more specific description, or better yet, email me)<p>Job Requirements: 
You know Java (or at least you're willing to learn it) - but hands-down you know some computer language cold.  You know it well enough to hate parts of it but yet probably understand why they're there.  You get why algorithms are important and know when to implement them and sometimes, when its better to just do it the easy way. You understand that startups experiment a lot - and consequently discover amazing things occasionally, but throw away code far more often.<p>The static credentials on your resume are great but honestly, its the dynamic stuff we're more interested in.<p>You've done stuff. You're proud of the stuff you've done. You can show us - heck, you can't wait to show us. It might be an iphone app, or an open source project, or a thread-safe cache-invalidation scheme, or a javascript game, or maybe you launched a startup. Either which way - you built something - start to finish. You can deliver.<p>The interview:<p>We love solving problems  and every interview question we ask is based on something we've actually had to code.  So we sometimes get rather excited to find a smart person willing to solve a problem a new way with us on a whiteboard. You should think this way too - you don't rate interviews as being easy or hard - you rate them as being boring or fun. And we definitely shoot for fun.  Right answers aren't the point - finding a good attack vector on the problem is.<p>Our CTO's take on getting your resume Silicon Valley ready:  <a href="http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-get-your-resume-silicon-valley.html" rel="nofollow">http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-get-your-resume-...</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5304319 href="vote?for=5304319_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%33%30%34%31%36%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5304319></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jack7890">jack7890</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5304319">link</a></span></div><br>

We’re venture funded and backed by an incredible group of investors, who include Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Lerer Ventures, SV Angel, Founder Collective, Joshua Schachter, and Chris Dixon.<p>We’re investing in mobile and tablet in a big way and are looking for someone to lead our iOS engineering efforts. We’re a young company with a brand new product, and are seeking a strong leader to grow with us as we grow as a company, and think it’s a great time to join and make an impact.<p>We’re tackling some interesting product and engineering challenges. To help us iterate and sustain momentum, we practice continuous deployment to the extent possible, which demands technical creativity with native Objective-C / Cocoa apps. On our backend servers, we ship upwards of twenty times a day — iOS development makes things more complex but it’s an area we’re interested in improving.<p>We ask a lot of our developers, but we offer a lot in exchange:<p>- Perks and benefits. Free lunch, an office arcade (3 cabinets!), competitive equity and salary with full benefits (health, dental, vision), take-what-you-need vacation.<p>- A great working environment, including whatever tools you need. Big monitors, the hardware setup you want. Sit-stand desks if you’re into that kind of thing.<p>- A voice in product development. Decisions aren’t made in a vacuum. Be a key player in building an amazing product.<p>- Transparency into the business. We review financials as a team monthly. Meetings aren’t held behind closed doors.<p>Our office is in Union Square, Manhattan. If you don’t live in New York City, we’ll fix that.<p>We’d love to hear from you!

Tidemark Systems (<a href="http://www.tidemark.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.tidemark.net</a>, note ".net") is hiring.<p>Like everybody else in the industry, we're finding hiring to be a difficult problem. For those of us on the UI team it's been an extra challenge -- there are lots of people out there who have experience with toolkits like jQuery, Ext, Sencha Touch, and a whole bunch of other ones, some of which we've never heard of. But we're not simply using frameworks, we're pushing them well beyond what they were intended to do. So if you've got relevant framework experience, that's great. But we really need engineers that are good at the basics: JavaScript, DOM, HTML, and CSS. You'll also need to be decent at UI design and user experience. If you're not just good but great at either of these things (or both!), that's awesome, but we also need you to be able to write code. This isn't just a run of the mill web dev job. This is actual, hard core software engineering, it just happens that the stuff we're (the UI team) doing is all running in the browser.<p>Tidemark is building a hosted business analytics system, which is way more interesting than it might sound. The company is well-funded and we have people with decades of experience in the field.<p>If this position sounds interesting, my email is on my profile page.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5306615 href="vote?for=5306615_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%33%30%34%31%36%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5306615></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ivyirwin">ivyirwin</a> 92 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5306615">link</a></span></div><br>

Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure (<a href="http://www.factual.com/jobs/clojure" rel="nofollow">http://www.factual.com/jobs/clojure</a>), machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop.

We build on a modern, open-source software stack which includes Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, Graphite, Chef, and Git.<p>We make extensive use of version control, configuration management, and automated testing, which lets us deploy code to production several times a day.<p><a href="https://smarkets.com/about/jobs/engineering" rel="nofollow">https://smarkets.com/about/jobs/engineering</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5375530 href="vote?for=5375530_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%51%54%66%56%4f%31%36%70%35%64%58%79%6c%66%51%73%50%49%35%55%66%6e"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5375530></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mattdennewitz">mattdennewitz</a> 80 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5375530">link</a></span></div><br>

We’re looking for a someone with sharp UX skills and some level of Django experience.<p>If you want to hack on things like:<p><pre><code>  - http://pitchfork.com/peopleslist/

and help push us further, this is the job for you. Your contributions will be seen daily by millions of people around the world, and you'll be a part of a design and dev team whose work has been praised for not only redefining music journalism, but influencing the medium itself.
About you: You should have real-world experience w/ Django 1.3+ as well as MySQL or Postgres. You should have a good eye for design even if you're not designing the project. You should love music; ideally you're familiar with the music we cover and the audience we cater to. Bonus points for experience with Jinja, Sass, Backbone, RQ, Redis, ElasticSearch or Solr, audio/video encoding, Vagrant; with AWS offerings such as EC2, RDS, SES, and CloudFront; with typography and grid layout fundamentals. Extra bonus points for familiarity with the infield fly rule, the ARP 2600, 2600 Quarterly, and/or Green Flash Brewery.<p>About us: We're a small team of full-stack devs. We move quickly and fluidly because the publishing environment demands it — not that we'd have it any other way. We juggle a few large sites and several satellite projects, so we make sure we spend our time coding, not staring at whiteboards.<p>We code a lot, we're rewarded by what we do (and win awards for it), and we've been known to have a beer while doing so. If you're interested in doing those things with us, send your resume and/or Github/Bitbucket profile to mattd /at\ pitchfork /dot\ com.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5304506 href="vote?for=5304506_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%51%54%66%56%4f%31%36%70%35%64%58%79%6c%66%51%73%50%49%35%55%66%6e"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5304506></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Ovid">Ovid</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5304506">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>IFTTT - <a href="http://ifttt.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">http://ifttt.com/jobs</a> - San Francisco, CA<p>IFTTT is looking for experienced engineers to help build the next generation of its platform.<p>This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We’re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we’re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.<p>We recently secured a new round of funding, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5306533 href="vote?for=5306533_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%51%54%66%56%4f%31%36%70%35%64%58%79%6c%66%51%73%50%49%35%55%66%6e"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5306533></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=smilliken">smilliken</a> 92 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5306533">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>SF, CA; ecommerce technology leader<p>OUR CHALLENGE:  ecommerce today is stuck as a metaphor of offline retail.  Online replications of the offline world may have extreme scale, but are highly disruptable since they are based on brick and mortar paradigms not actual customer/brand relationships.  iTunes was the best online record store imaginable, but Spotify is quickly disrupting it.  Amazon is a (very, very well run) giant Wal-Mart – ecommerce can be better than massive-scale superstores.<p>Our software changes the online retail from "superstores" to multi-year, high-value brand/consumer relationships.  We do this by facilitating long-term, multi-SKU relationships between brands and customers.   The first market we are targeting is household products – because it’s huge, underserved online, and going through rapid channel shift (and, the multi-SKU element works incredibly well in this niche).<p>MISSION STATEMENT ePantry's mission is to shrink the environmental footprint of American homes by making sustainably produced household products the most convenient option for busy consumers. Our technology provides each individual with customized ongoing delivery of branded sustainable consumables (e.g. soap, laundry detergent, paper towels) simplifying the process of never running out of the products he/she needs.  You will enjoy buying toilet paper!<p>WORTH KNOWING<p>* High-friction (private) MVP reached $200k run rate in first month with $0 marketing.<p>* Annual ARPU _#62;$500<p>* $40 billion niche with _#60;2% ecommerce penetration<p>* Well-funded by the entrepreneurs _#38; investors behind Hotwire, Friendster, Everfi, and Citysearch<p>* @RocketSpace<p>* Niche ecommerce works: Alice, Dollar Shave Club, Manpacks, Quidsi, Zappos<p>* Team of 4 full time.

Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalising specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us; we're hiring for all technical roles.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts. Brands include fashion, beauty, homeware, and lifestyle categories, many familiar from the high street. The company has about 80 employees and a substantial annual turnover.

We'd love to find someone who can hop back and forth between the PHP, D3, Angular, etc., and it's even better if they've got some design sensibilities and can help shape the product's features and functionality too.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>LONDON, UK<p>Makers Academy (<a href="http://www.makersacademy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.makersacademy.com</a>) is an 10 week, intensive, full-time course in web development. We only accept the best students, teach them the basics of web development and help find a job as a junior software developer. We're expanding, so we're looking for additional teachers.<p>Teaching is hard but very rewarding and enjoyable. We're looking for contractors (10+ weeks) experienced with Ruby, Rails and related technologies who can not only write beautiful code but can explain how they do it.<p>We started Makers Academy to address both growing demand for developers and high unemployment rates. We don't believe in lectures but we spend most time coding (pairing) and the rest of the time doing interactive workshops. The main thing we're teaching is the mindset of a developer, the ability to understand and solve unexpected challenges.<p>We're funded by our parent company, Forward Internet Group (<a href="http://www.forward.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.forward.co.uk</a>). Our pay is competitive (not to mention usual perks like massage, video games and breakfasts)<p>If you'd like to know more about why we started Makers Academy and how we teach, please email me at evgeny@makersacademy.com.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5345346 href="vote?for=5345346_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%51%54%66%56%4f%31%36%70%35%64%58%79%6c%66%51%73%50%49%35%55%66%6e"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5345346></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jacobmorse">jacobmorse</a> 85 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5345346">link</a></span></div><br>

Expertise in Java or JVM tuning is a plus, but not required.<p>How to Get Your Resume Noticed
* Provide github, side projects, hackathon experience or other manners of code samples.  We love open source and we want productive, passionate coders who love it too.
* Include a cover letter that talks about your experience scaling, performance tuning and distributing computational workload. Highlight times you have pushed a technology to its limit, and what you learned along the way.<p>How to Ace to Interview
* Write clean, practical, idiomatic code in a statically typed language to answer coding questions.  We’re not looking for a trick ah-ah answers.  Focus first on a reasonable, functionally correct implementation and then iteratively improve on it if necessary.
* Show off your technical knowledge, experience and instincts discussing your implementation’s run-time, scalability pain-points and how you would horizontally scale.
* Excitedly talk about how you’ve worked at scale or high throughput, and what technical challenges you overcame as it ramped up.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The Genome Institute at St. Louis, MO<p>Job Description<p>The Genome Institute at Washington University has an opening for a talented software engineer in the Bioinformatics group. The position will work with an experienced group of software engineers to develop software supporting the tracking of laboratory data and analysis processes to support large scale genomic research projects.<p>The Genome Institute has been at the forefront of genome research since its inception in 1993 and has been a part of major scientific projects such as the Human Genome, 1000 Genomes and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) Projects. The Genome Institute is a world-leader in the generation and analysis of genomic sequence data and uses this data to extend biological knowledge of the human genome and provide clinically relevant sequence analysis aimed at understanding human diseases (such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease). In addition, the Institute fosters public understanding of genomic science through various educational and outreach efforts.<p>Job Qualifications<p>The ideal candidate has a talent and love for writing software, is interested in developing that skill, and applying it in a production environment. The candidate will be expected to learn new things on a regular basis, think critically, and collaborate with other developers across groups. The environment is fast-paced and a person who likes to get things done will find a lot of opportunity.<p>Design, testing, debugging, and problem analysis are a regular part of the work. Skills in abstract software design, object-oriented architecture, relational data modeling, and web interface design will be used frequently, which will require thorough knowledge of each concept. The applicant will use these skills to develop software that will: interface with people and/or laboratory equipment, process and analyze large data sets on a compute cluster, and provide intuitive web based interfaces to the specifications of the laboratory managers and technicians.<p>Proficiency in dynamically typed languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, Lisp, etc.) is a plus, but not required. Understanding of relational databases and SQL will be helpful. Experience with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and approaches such as REST and AJAX is an asset. Regular work will be done in GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like development environments. Familiarity with open source technologies, version control software such as git, and programming in a network environment are also assets.<p>Certification or degree in computer programming from a technical school or college plus two years of relevant work experience required. Additional relevant programming experience may be substituted on a year-for-year basis for required education.<p>You can also send questions and resumes directly to me.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5304892 href="vote?for=5304892_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%51%54%66%56%4f%31%36%70%35%64%58%79%6c%66%51%73%50%49%35%55%66%6e"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5304892></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=taylorbuley">taylorbuley</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5304892">link</a></span></div><br>

We’ve been self funded for about 1.5 years and are 1-2 months away from raising money.<p>~We have paying customers and a growing user base.~<p>www.thresholdcm.com<p>Application Description: Threshold is a web and iOS application that tackles the needs of the construction industry by rapidly improving the communication and documentation process. We believe elegant design and intuitive UI isn’t just for consumer-focused companies.<p>What we're looking for: A full stack Ruby on Rails developer located in San Francisco. It will be a contract position to start but we’re looking for a technical co-founder with a good amount of equity.<p>What we’re looking for: The position will touch on all aspects of our app including backend and frontend coding (strong JS skills a must), database management and optimization, and deployment and server administration. A keen eye for design is a plus. You MUST be comfortable iterating quickly and pushing code that’s not 100% tested. We’re strong believers that faster feature pushes are more important than ironclad code at this phase in our company.<p>What you’re looking for: To join a small and focused team that’s looking to revolutionize an old and antiquated industry. You want to build a real company with real revenue. You want to be part of a team and have a say in the direction our company takes.<p>Job Requirements: 
Excellent knowledge of Ruby and jQuery. 
Strong background in CSS and Javascript
MySQL experience. 
Linux experience, and setting up web servers with Nginx. 
Comfortable with merchant processing integration (Stripe) a plus.<p>Requirements: Any applicants must submit URLs to dynamic websites that they have built. Any submissions without examples of previous work will be disregarded. We are particularly interested in strong problem-solving skills, and the ability to iterate and build things quickly. This is a start-up, and being able to rapidly prototype and build out new features is critical.<p>Compensation: Contractor with an hourly wage depending on your experience level. We’re looking for a third co-founder so equity in our company should be something that motivates you. Full salary / benefits when funding occurs.<p>Learn More: www.thresholdcm.com

We’re looking to replace our previously incoming CTO, who was promoted unexpectedly at his current full-time employer. We plan to pay salary commensurate with an established NYC startup, with meaningful equity…not a sub-percentage that you might find elsewhere. Flyer has been founded by two former finance professionals and is building out its team in advance of a July pilot. We've been funding to date on our own and have ~$1mm of capital lined up at ~$10mm valuation.<p>Our team is looking to get your advice, input and guidance on a range of important technology elements of our organization. Areas of focus over the next year will include scalability of the platform as we launch and grow the user base and volume of content in our system, and feature additions as we learn what users want/need.<p>Backend: we’re building our our Ruby-based API in the Padrino framework, which should allow us better performance than Rails, while utilizing a similar structure. We’d like to incorporate your vision as the API is developed, and want your input on solving a number of challenges around the database and data model, all of which tie in to Flyer’s core goal of delivering relevant event-related content to users.<p>Front-end: a native iOS app using native iOS tools, developed in Objective-C using the Cocoa framework. We will only use the most proven open source libraries to make the code reliable and enjoyable. My co-founder and I have been working on the UX for seven months: two full wireframing processes, weeks of FieldTest user testing and tweaking UI, etc. We're looking forward to getting these screens fully functional so we can continue to test and improve.<p>Overall, it’s been a very engaging challenge finding solutions across the many aspects of creating this product.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Location: Chicago, IL<p>Position: Software Engineer<p>Company: MarkITx<p>MarkITx is looking for talented generalists join our software engineering team. We want colleagues who are smart and get things done, who are inveterate builders, tinkerers and detectives. We hire people not experience levels, so we have a place for you whether you have been building real-time trading systems for a decade, or are fresh out of school.<p>MarkITx is a B2B exchange for buying and selling IT hardware (anything that goes into a datacenter). We are disrupting the $350B secondary IT market by bringing simplicity and transparency to a process that is currently painful, ugly and untrustworthy. We are a funded startup, working out of 1871. We are a very talented, deeply experienced and tight-knit team. We have some of the best backers and advisors in Chicago. We’ve proven the model, with over $20MM in orders and over $150k per week in transactions, roughly doubling every month. We’re just getting started, and we need your help to scale that.<p>Building a commodities exchange from scratch is an unique challenge. Working with a world class team of designers, front-end developers and industry experts, you will build the beating heart of our trading platform. You will become an expert in every layer of our stack, including Node.js, ElasticSearch, Redis and AWS. You’ll integrate with dozens of APIs from services like FedEx, Dwolla, Dropbox and NetSuite. You’ll help build and document our own API so that our users can tap directly into the exchange.<p>If that sounds like fun, see the details at <a href="https://www.markitx.com/careers#engineer" rel="nofollow">https://www.markitx.com/careers#engineer</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5305018 href="vote?for=5305018_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4f%39%63%62%4b%32%47%77%41%36%50%6e%38%36%6d%6b%4f%55%73%4f%74%52"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5305018></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mikek">mikek</a> 93 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5305018">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Essess - Boston, MA<p>Here's a posting we sent out last week to a few MIT mailing lists:<p>Looking for a startup job? Want to make a difference? I, along with another MIT Media Lab grad, work at Essess and we're hiring.<p>We looking for coders, building scientists, and computer vision experts.<p>About our company: Forbes called us the "Google Street View of energy efficiency". We use thermal cameras to map energy leaks at city scales to help our customers make smart decisions about their energy use.<p>Our first product, launching in the next month, is a home energy report that will allow home owners to literally see the heat leaking from their homes, allowing them make informed decisions about possible improvements.<p>Here's our big idea: In the coming years, we want to create a nationwide energy market to allow us to identify properties that would benefit the most from an energy efficiency upgrade.<p>We would offer free home improvements to homeowners. In return, the homeowner agrees to a fixed energy bill for some period of time. The homeowner, instead of paying the utilities directly, would pay us and in return would receive a lower, predictable monthly energy bill.<p>Our mission is to build and drive this market. We're excited about using technology to help the environment and help people live more comfortable, less-impactful lives.<p>That's our idea… but we need your help make it a reality.<p>Come talk to us!

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>CoverHound - San Francisco, CA - <a href="http://coverhound.com" rel="nofollow">http://coverhound.com</a><p>Software Engineer, Ruby on Rails<p>We are creating a more transparent market in insurance. Our services enable users to shop for car insurance and renters insurance online, immediately retrieving accurate and actionable rates from partnered insurance carriers. Our customers can then purchase one of the policies directly from us via our licensed insurance agents.<p>We have just raised a $4.5 million Series A and are filling out our staff. Our intention is to add more lines of insurance (homeowners, motorcycle, umbrella) as well as tools which make managing insurance policies more pleasant.<p>As a Software Engineer you will be a full-stack Rails developer who works in a small team of fellow coders. Your manager will be an experienced developer. Here you will be able to sharpen your Rails skills and put them to good use.<p>Our environment is comfortable. Aside for very rare pushes, nobody works more than 40 hours. We encourage our employees to work from home once a week.<p>Tools we would like applicants to be somewhat knowledgable in: Ruby on Rails, MySQL, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, CSS/SCSS. We develop on Macs, but this is not a necessity. We use the standard Test::Unit testing framework which is bundled with Rails, and we do not enforce anything like TDD.<p>If you are interested, please send an email to joel@coverhound.com with your info.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Wello: SF or REMOTE fulltime (near pacific time)
At Wello (<a href="https://www.wello.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.wello.com</a>), we are rethinking how people get fit. Gyms do not work for 89% of Americans, but yet they are a $21B industry thanks to recurring fees. We are trying to change that by bringing the Gym to your home over live video and eliminating waste. If the country gets a little more fitter using our platform, thats all the more good.
We want you to come help us engineer this transition. We are doing what AirBnb, Uber and others did with excess capacity in their markets to fitness professional market. 
Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We just recently launched Group workouts. We just graduated from Rock Health and have some great investors who get marketplaces like us. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide.
We use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. No one has yet got a six-pack but we could probably all run long distance. We are small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. We love the Netflix philosophy of context and control.
Our technical stack is Python and MySQL. We also use Fabric, NGinx, Apache, Celery, Redis and RabbitMQ.
Contact us at dev@wello.co.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5306990 href="vote?for=5306990_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4f%39%63%62%4b%32%47%77%41%36%50%6e%38%36%6d%6b%4f%55%73%4f%74%52"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5306990></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mschaecher">mschaecher</a> 92 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5306990">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>FULLTIME - H1B available - PALO ALTO, CA<p>TRIALPAY in Palo Alto is hiring great full-stack and back-end engineers. We're a venture backed startup in the online payments/advertising space and service hundreds of millions of impressions per day. We work on getting users to try new products and services, play new games, and visit new stores by giving them stuff that they already want for free (e.g. free movie tickets if you sign up for Zipcar, free Facebook credits if you sign up for Gamefly, and so on). In addition, with the advent of a huge Visa investment, we're working on completely changing the nature of offline commerce by connecting it with the online world -- with our help, brick and mortar businesses can draw causal links between their online advertising campaigns and offline sales and answer burning questions like, “Did that old-timey looking product photo we posted last week actually get people in our store?”<p>We have great revenue, we respect great ideas no matter where they come from, and in general, the consensus here is that we work with the smartest people we've ever met.<p>Sound cool?

If you're ever interested in additional freelance work, do let me know. I do business consulting/digital marketing work and occasionally have a requirement to outsource work to a developer. I have a project that needs quoting on today in fact although I kind of pegged another developer for it, but he hasnt confirmed his availability with me just yet.

What level of salary would you consider as a minimum along with equity?
