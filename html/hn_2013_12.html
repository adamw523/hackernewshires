<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>If you could work anywhere, what would you do?<p>- Wouldn_#x27;t you want to work towards genuinely making the world a better place?<p>- Wouldn_#x27;t you want to work in a close-knit team alongside some of the brightest engineers in the industry?<p>- Wouldn_#x27;t you want to work on solving interesting problems that haven_#x27;t been solved before?<p>---<p>At Khan Academy, I truly believe that you can find all of those things and more. We_#x27;re a small, 50-person nonprofit tech startup making a big difference in the world. A few weeks ago, we found this great story through the fascinating blog _quot;Humans of New York_quot; – please take a moment to read it:<p><a href="http://www.humansofnewyork.com/post/64412654576/i-struck-up-a-conversation-with-him-and-he" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.humansofnewyork.com_#x2F;post_#x2F;64412654576_#x2F;i-struck-up-...</a><p>This is just one story, but every month we hear about hundreds of lives that we_#x27;ve transformed, and there are thousands more we don_#x27;t hear about.<p>Lots of people know us for Sal_#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers and a huge library of math practice exercises. Our 100,000+ practice problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total. That_#x27;s a huge number.<p>This gives us the ability to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do. We_#x27;ve run tests which show that students learn more when they_#x27;re advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. As I write this we_#x27;re running dozens of A_#x2F;B tests to learn what we can do to make people learn more, from testing how review scheduling affects accuracy to simply testing different teaching styles.<p>Whether you_#x27;re a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. You_#x27;ll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business – though we have _quot;celebrity_quot; devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google_#x27;s first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven_#x27;t heard of but who are just as awesome.<p>---<p>I_#x27;m going to put in a special plug for mobile: Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two people (me and one other person) working on our apps right now. Our iOS app is fairly basic, but it already has a few million downloads. We want to make it awesome. If you_#x27;re a mobile developer we can build a great team around, <i>please</i> reach out. You can_#x27;t find this sort of opportunity in very many places.<p>We_#x27;re hiring engineers (web, mobile, data science), product designers, a community manager, and more. Oh, and if you want to have a great summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we_#x27;re hiring interns too.<p>Apply at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/careers" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.khanacademy.org_#x2F;careers</a> directly (say you saw us on HN!) or feel free to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org with any questions.<p>[1]: <a href="http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machine-learning-measurable-learning" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;derandomized.com_#x2F;post_#x2F;51729670543_#x2F;khan-academy-machin...</a><p>[2]: <a href="http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdown" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;bjk5.com_#x2F;post_#x2F;44698559168_#x2F;breaking-down-amazons-mega-...</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6827735 href="vote?for=6827735_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%38%32%37%35%35%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6827735></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=midko">midko</a> 155 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6827735">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;re Waze for Cargo. Building hardware to put inside of shipping containers so our customers get realtime visibility into their supply chain.

Really neat stuff.<p><pre><code>  ===========================

With about 35 years of moving stuff around for a living (from bike messenger to air cargo and all in-between) I can resonate with Weft. Had it existed years ago I would have fewer white hairs.

The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.<p>Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.<p>FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER As a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.<p>SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING The flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.<p>We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldn’t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.<p>When considering you as a candidate, we won’t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that you’re smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that you’re an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. You’re the engineer that other engineers can count on—you’re highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the team’s passionate dedication to the mission.<p>At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and “launching” the product will be like no other product launch you’ve ever experienced!
Note for new or recent graduates: If you’re a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer. This will go a long way with your application.<p>You can apply online or e-mail your resume to ryan.fitzpatrick@spacex.com.

Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.<p>Effective October 18, 2012, all claims administrators (insurance companies, self-insured employers, et al) for California workers compensation claims are required to be able to receive bills electronically.<p>DaisyBill is the facilitator for practices to take advantage of this new law, allowing them to enter in the information about services rendered, seeing both what they should charge for the services and what they should expect to be paid (as these are not always the same). DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper_#x2F;snail mail. We_#x27;re talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more. This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.<p>--<p>We_#x27;re looking for someone to help us with a new product_#x2F;revenue stream we_#x27;re going to be developing shortly. This product is a new fee calculator as the current one is expiring after the new year. We_#x27;re also going to be integrating with third party billers that are currently unable to submit workers comp bills electronically. There is no shortage of work to be done and there is a lot of money to be made.<p>I_#x27;m Kris, the CTO and sole developer at DaisyBill. Previously I was at ThoughtWorks, then Pivotal Labs. I decided to get out of consulting and into a product company because I wanted to own the product I was working on. DaisyBill is the only company out of many I considered that has a solid business plan with an intent to make a lot of money and do some good in the process.<p>I_#x27;m looking for a senior developer that is experienced with Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript. The stack we currently run is Rails 3.2_#x2F;PostgreSQL 9.2 on Heroku. I_#x27;d like to rewrite the site using AngularJS at some point in the near future, so Angular experience is a plus. We also don_#x27;t have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX_#x2F;UI is also a plus. We use Git and I_#x27;d expect any new hire to either already know Git quite well or be unafraid of it and be able to be brought up to speed quickly. I currently develop on an iMac with MacVim, and most people in the office use a standing desk.<p>You would be pairing reasonably regularly for the first few weeks but be expected to work independently not long after joining, asking questions as necessary. We also do a loose form of TDD: I typically like to sketch out an idea before trying to bake it in with tests. I also don_#x27;t test every line of code. I believe in being pragmatic about testing. We use RSpec and Jasmine.<p>I do interviews similarly to the way they_#x27;re done at Pivotal: After chatting about what you_#x27;re looking for in a position I_#x27;d have you come in and pair on some code. I care a lot about the interview process allowing the candidate to suss out whether the work environment and the actual work is what they_#x27;re interested in. I don_#x27;t do conference room whiteboard programming.<p>I don_#x27;t have a degree, and I don_#x27;t expect you to have one, either. I don_#x27;t necessarily care about how long you_#x27;ve been a developer, either. I care about the quality of your code today and your approach to solving problems. If you_#x27;re capable and can show it, I_#x27;m interested.<p>You may reach me at khicks@daisybill.com.<p>Cheers.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6828702 href="vote?for=6828702_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%38%32%37%35%35%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6828702></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pbiggar">pbiggar</a> 155 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6828702">link</a></span></div><br>

As one example we_#x27;ve recently vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler and added reified keywords to the runtime to make ClojureScript a better citizen on the web.

You should be willing to learn, or already know, technologies like Tornado, MongoDB, Redis, Solr, Postgres, Cassandra, Pig, Storm, and Amazon Web Services. You should be extremely handy at a UNIX command line, possessing all the skills of a sysadmin.<p>Also, if you happen to be an experienced software engineer who wants to end up in a role with a mixture of product management, customer interaction, and individual contributions to the code, we have just the position for you. Let us know -- we_#x27;re looking for you.<p>If you join us, you_#x27;ll be part of a well-funded and high-revenue SaaS analytics company that is rewriting the rules of online media.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Union Square, San Francisco, CA. Full-time. Full-stack Engineer, All Levels.<p>Red Hot Labs (RHL) is looking for full-stack engineers at all levels that want to work on cutting edge business intelligence _amp; machine-learning tools and services for mobile developers.<p>=Responsibilities=<p><pre><code>    - Write both server and client-side code for massively scalable analytics architectures. 
      (We can teach you this!)
    - Actively learn and work with new technologies. There’s a very good chance 
      you’ll pick up experience with a new language _#x2F; technology stack here!
    - Collaborate closely with our CEO and the rest of our team to develop 
      products and services with a high quality user-experience. 
    - Architect and own big parts of our infrastructure. 

</code></pre>
=Your skills=<p><pre><code>    - REQUIRED: CS degree or significant experience in a low-level language (C, C++). 
         - We_#x27;re trying to hire smart folks that have a solid CS foundation.
    - REQUIRED: Prior experience working with either Javascript or Ruby.
    - REQUIRED: Ability to pick up new languages and frameworks quickly.
    - PREFERRED: Prior experience developing business intelligence or analytical tools.

</code></pre>
=Why Red Hot Labs=<p>We’re a small 4-person FUNDED startup founded by the guys who made FarmVille and CityVille. We’re building business intelligence tools and services that we think are missing from the mobile ecosystem. This is not our first startup; our last one was acquired by Zynga and led to them being able to IPO using our core-tech and games.<p>Our company culture is one built on learning and the belief that everyone is a student and everyone is a teacher. We want to work with folks that inspire us to learn more and do our best work. We invest in our employees and want to help you grow in both your core skill-set and other areas you may be interested in. We can afford to do this while we’re small.<p>We originally began building mobile games and realized there was a big hole in mobile business intelligence and in bringing together and understanding all of the data that exists out there. We focus on shipping quickly and constantly (our first product was built in 6 weeks with no pre-existing client-side code), so this is a great place to experience shipping multiple products.<p>We have since shut down the development of games and are focusing 100% on our tools and service products. We still maintain and run the games and use them as test beds for new ideas.<p>=Perks=<p><pre><code>    - WORKCATIONS! We’re a small company so we do unscalable things such as 
      rent a house for the whole team and spend a week working from a Ski-house Tahoe 
      or in a beach-house in Hawaii. 
    - Early-stage startup equity grants
    - Health_#x2F;Dental_#x2F;Vision insurance
 
</code></pre>
=Our stack=<p><pre><code>    - Redis, Couchbase, Rails for our backend API.
    - Mostly AWS with a little bit of Heroku for our hosting.
    - AngularJS, jQuery, Underscore for our dashboard and web apps.
    - 3rd party services: Facebook, Mixpanel, Stripe, Mailgun

We_#x27;re the special operations team for the corporate world.<p>We_#x27;re hunting for engaging problems and opportunities to create real value for our marketing, sales, and research teams throughout our international businesses (television, movies, news, and home entertainment).<p>You_#x27;ll be helping us on a variety of problems - little ones like writing a script to hack a third party_#x27;s website and collect info on our products, to large ones like creating a model that can show our products value through time. In all cases you_#x27;ll be working closely with the a senior engineer and either senior corporate management or a business unit in TV, film, or news. A typical week might look like this:<p>* Meet with the head of sales for a UK TV channel, learn about a problem they_#x27;re facing trying to get an accurate value for advertisement slots.<p>* Discuss what you learned with the rest of team. Someone suggests that a nearest-neighbors regression on data from the marketing team might help.<p>* A senior dev helps you implement the algorithm and a UI for the sales team to use it.<p>* Spend some time with the sales team to see if it_#x27;s creating any value, look for improvements.<p>What we use (We list this to tell you what we_#x27;re like, not to tell you what languages we expect to see on a CV):<p>* Racket. We_#x27;re big fans lisp and functional programming.<p>* Bash. We create a lot of value with small dirty hacky shell scripts, and we aren_#x27;t shy about it.<p>* Whatever gets the job done, and whatever we think might be fun to use. Python, R, Javascript, Hadoop, EC2. We even wrote code in Fortran once (we don_#x27;t like to talk about it.)<p>Who we_#x27;re looking for:<p>Most importantly, you should be an intelligent problem solver who wants to apply whatever programming and maths knowledge you have to real world problems. We_#x27;re not fussed about what languages are on your CV.<p>You have some familiarity with functional programming, machine learning, and linux_#x2F;bash scripting, and you_#x27;re eager for a chance to use it on real-world problems with support from other programmers. Given the predictive modeling angle, you_#x27;re probably studying or have studied maths, stats, or even physics.<p>These are two assistant_#x2F;internship positions for students looking for experience while doing their degree. Alternatively, if you can take on several projects in a full time role, please get in touch, too. We_#x27;re pretty flexible.<p>Interested? My contact details are in my profile. Get in touch.

This growth in data means that we need an effective way to store massive amounts of data. OpenStack Swift is designed to effectively store massive amounts of data while providing high durability, high availability, and support massive concurrency across the entire data set. SwiftStack is building management, monitoring, and integration tools to turn the Swift storage engine into an effective storage solution that is used by millions, daily.<p>We_#x27;re looking for engineers of all experience levels to join us. We do most of our work in Python, but we_#x27;ve got some Ruby, Javascript, and a few other things mixed into our stack.<p>So far this year, we_#x27;ve built out global clusters for a major expense reporting and travel support site[1], provided the storage system for Disney Interactive_#x27;s gaming platform[2], and integrated Swift into radical new hard drive technology from Seagate[3]. We_#x27;re currently working with companies like Intel and Box to build support for erasure codes into Swift[4].<p>My vision for OpenStack Swift is that it will be used by everyone, every day, even if they don_#x27;t realize it. Swift is storage that is built for the web and already powers some of the world_#x27;s largest storage clouds. I would like to work with you at SwiftStack to see this vision become a reality.<p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done. Tell us in a few lines of text why you’re interested in SwiftStack, and why we’ll be interested in you. We’ll be back in touch shortly to get the conversation started.<p>[1] Concur video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQmGfzewWQw_amp;t=29m23s" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.youtube.com_#x2F;watch?v=qQmGfzewWQw_amp;t=29m23s</a><p>[2] Disney + SwiftStack: <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/08/30/how-disney-built-a-giant-cloud-by-bolting-two-together/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;venturebeat.com_#x2F;2013_#x2F;08_#x2F;30_#x2F;how-disney-built-a-giant-c...</a><p>[3] SwiftStack + Seagate: <a href="http://swiftstack.com/blog/2013/10/22/kinetic-for-openstack-swift-with-seagate/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;swiftstack.com_#x2F;blog_#x2F;2013_#x2F;10_#x2F;22_#x2F;kinetic-for-openstack-...</a><p>[4] Building erasure codes into OpenStack Swift: <a href="http://swiftstack.com/blog/2013/07/17/erasure-codes-with-openstack-swift-digging-deeper/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;swiftstack.com_#x2F;blog_#x2F;2013_#x2F;07_#x2F;17_#x2F;erasure-codes-with-ope...</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6828289 href="vote?for=6828289_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%38%32%37%35%35%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6828289></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rywang">rywang</a> 155 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6828289">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco<p>Intrans<p>Ruby Engineers, Android<p>The last 50 years has seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world_#x27;s first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping.<p>Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it_#x27;s hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry.
We are changing that. We use our location-based technology to automatically match supply and demand.<p>If you_#x27;re ready to transform the trucking industry, send your resume and GitHub profile to jobs@intrans.com.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6829521 href="vote?for=6829521_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%38%32%37%35%35%34"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6829521></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jbk">jbk</a> 155 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6829521">link</a></span></div><br>

Come join Iterable, the next generation email optimization company.<p>Email usage is changing, but the technology and capabilities haven_#x27;t caught up to the 21st century. We_#x27;re a small team of hackers and thinkers who are creating the next generation email optimization platform. Our team has experience at big tech companies (Twitter, Google, SIG) and we want to bring and improve the technology that powers user growth and commerce at these places to everyone. This means writing code that improves the lives of our customers (series seed and series A companies) and their millions of email subscribers.<p>One of our top level goals is to build a uniquely fun and growth oriented company culture. This is a journey, not a rat race. Knowledge sharing in any capacity is highly valued here -- are you interested in prediction markets or PGP encryption? Do you enjoy teaching posture techniques or purely functional data structures to others? We pair program, design together, and generally create a learn-and-teach environment here.<p>If you_#x27;re interested in coming on board, you can help with some challenges we face: - Scale our API to beyond millions of requests - Design and write performant, beautiful interfaces - Write software to build machine learned user models - Make data visualizations for our email and user data - Design an immutable infrastructure for our platform
Some aspects of our culture that make us different: - We are all very focused on self improvement - Our company has egalitarian and transparent values: work when you want, on what you want. - We are chill and empathetic people - The company is completely transparent<p>You_#x27;ll get to work with us at our office at Kleiner Perkins_#x27; startup incubation space in SoMa.

Here_#x27;s an example for the week of Oct-28 (<a href="http://bit.ly/18vVfpJ" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;bit.ly_#x2F;18vVfpJ</a>) - % of users who come back after week-2, week-3 _amp; week-4.<p>_quot;If 30% of users return to your site after 3 weeks, you_#x27;re onto something_quot; - Bing Gordon. And we are much more than that after 4 weeks.<p>Investors: 
We are a part of YC summer batch of 2011, backed by Vinod Khosla and a team of 28 growing incredibly fast in a huge market (<a href="http://on.wsj.com/17stW9f" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;on.wsj.com_#x2F;17stW9f</a>)<p>Enterprise: Our enterprise product (white-labeled version) is used by some of the top tech companies (Facebook, Amazon, Square, Palantir, Evernote, Quora, etc.) for making their interview process effective. That_#x27;s how we make money right now and we are going to hit a $1M in revenue very very soon.<p>Hiring: We are hiring for various roles (hackers, sales, marketing, PM_#x27;s) at both the places. If you_#x27;re interested, please send me your online profile or resume to vivek [at] hackerrank. It_#x27;ll be one of the best decisions in your life.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Notting Hill, London, England, U.K.<p>Our web application is at the heart of our busy and successful e-commerce business; every day it serves millions of product images and handles thousands of purchases, but we can and do update the live site with new code anytime we want without missing a beat. Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and deployed on Amazon Web Services; we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, at the moment we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. Our developers are generalizing specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we_#x27;d like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who_#x27;d like to join us; we_#x27;re hiring for all technical roles.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK_#x27;s leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts. Brands include fashion, beauty, homeware, and lifestyle categories, many familiar from the high street. The company has about 80 employees and a substantial annual turnover. The firm is growing quickly after a recent investment round.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6827708 href="vote?for=6827708_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%70%58%38%37%4c%61%53%35%58%50%77%42%67%58%79%4f%35%39%6e%4a%6d%70"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6827708></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=EmilLondon">EmilLondon</a> 155 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6827708">link</a></span></div><br>

The best description however is found by simply installing the app (Iphone only at the moment - we_#x27;re in the app store, Android soon - see job description below!) and trying it yourself.<p>We_#x27;re super proud of the team we_#x27;ve built and we plan to keep the caliber high.
We have exactly one requirement for hiring an engineer - it_#x27;s someone we_#x27;d like to work with. That_#x27;s a simple statement, but if you dig deeper, there_#x27;s a lot to it. It says that we think they_#x27;re smart. And that we could learn from them. And that they could learn from us. And that we get along, and they fit our culture. And they_#x27;re passionate about our product like we are. And of course - that they also want to work with us.<p>Our interviews are fun - at least we think so. They_#x27;re largely modeled after Google interviews (there_#x27;s a lot of Google interviewing experience in our team). Questions are either real problems we_#x27;ve had to solve (probably recently) or some abstractification of a bigger problem to see how you attack problems in general (with the _quot;getting the right answer_quot; not being the interesting part of the interview).<p>Specifically - We_#x27;re looking for:<p>Backend Developers:
You_#x27;re a crackshot in your backend language of choice. As I said, we_#x27;re building a system that does an incredible amount of work all while the user is waiting for it to complete - so needless to say, we_#x27;re looking for people who care about performance. A lot.<p>Our backend is a highly concurrent system written in Java using MongoDB. You might know Java or you might not, but either way you_#x27;re willing to learn. If you don_#x27;t know it - you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.<p>You love to code. You love to show off your results now and then to other engineers (as they_#x27;re probably the only folks around who might get the intricacies of what you_#x27;re excited about)<p>We_#x27;re looking for both Senior and Junior backend engineers. If you_#x27;re a Senior Engineer - you_#x27;ve worked in server-side code for a few years. You_#x27;ve scaled to thousands or millions of users. You can talk to other Senior engineers with very few words because you both know the special cases, assumptions, and pitfalls cold.<p>If you_#x27;re a Junior engineer, you love to code and you_#x27;re good at it. But most importantly - Be smart. Be passionate. Be excited. (New grads please apply!)<p>Android and IOS engineers:<p>You have apps in the store you can show us. You care about the user experience. You have a few years under your belt in either Objective-C or Android-Java.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6840440 href="vote?for=6840440_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%70%58%38%37%4c%61%53%35%58%50%77%42%67%58%79%4f%35%39%6e%4a%6d%70"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6840440></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dianamp">dianamp</a> 153 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6840440">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Rinse ( <a href="http://www.rinse.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.rinse.com</a> ) - San Francisco, CA Rinse is a very early-stage startup (we are only 4 people currently) looking to bring technology to the dry-cleaning industry. The industry is ripe for innovation! We_#x27;re building mobile apps, tackling scheduling and dispatch problems, and scaling a service at over 10% week-on-week growth for months now.
I know _#x27;app for laundry_#x27; is a tech cliché right now, but we_#x27;re definitely encountering real demand. The problem is real, and we_#x27;re solving it.<p>The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading operations, and a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition. I_#x27;m Stanford CS_#x2F;EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business. The tech stack is Heroku _#x2F; Python _#x2F; Django _#x2F; Celery _#x2F; Phonegap _#x2F; JQuery _#x2F; Backbone _#x2F; Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well. We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.<p>We_#x27;re looking for a Web Developer or Front-end Developer to develop interfaces for our customers, tools for our personnel, and visualizations for our managements. Ideally, this person would also have an active role in the design process as well, either leading design or working with our contract designer.<p>We_#x27;re also looking for a Director of Marketing. Rinse is a quintessential B2C business, with plenty of opportunities for online advertising, offline collateral, partnerships, and _#x27;growth hacking._#x27; We_#x27;re building a scalable business model and the technology to support it, now help us scale the business.

But we_#x27;re starting to diversify from _quot;behind-the-scenes_quot; work to more early-stage product development.<p>Fundamentally, we like to work on tools that helping people make better decisions.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We_#x27;re a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and_#x2F;or on infrastructure.<p>No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Visit <a href="http://amacapital.net/careers.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;amacapital.net_#x2F;careers.html</a> to learn more, and send applications_#x2F;inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6831475 href="vote?for=6831475_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%70%58%38%37%4c%61%53%35%58%50%77%42%67%58%79%4f%35%39%6e%4a%6d%70"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6831475></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=vfiles">vfiles</a> 154 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6831475">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Layer (<a href="https://layer.com" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;layer.com</a>) San Francisco, CA<p>The Internet needs an open communications layer -- cross-platform and free from an advertising-supported business model. At Layer, we’re on a mission to deliver it. We’re hiring iOS, Android, backend, Web and systems engineers, as well as designers.<p>We have problems to solve that you’ll have a hard time finding elsewhere.  Here’s why:<p>We’re building our own network.  We need fine-grained control over latency and geographic distribution.  We’ll be running our own AS (62862), peering at major exchanges, and purchasing transit from high-quality providers.<p>We’re running our own hardware.  This goes to latency again: by owning our own routers, by being particular about what switches run behind them, and by provisioning memory and persistent storage specific to our application, we can deliver a better experience to our customers.  We can also deliver at lower cost.<p>We’re designing our software for high availability.  Losing a datacenter will not impact the availability of our service.<p>We’re building our mobile SDKs to provide a complete solution: offline message buffering, cross-device handling of push notifications, cross-device message sync, respectful battery consumption, and in front of it all, a simple api.<p>We care about documentation: <a href="https://layer.com/docs/ios" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;layer.com_#x2F;docs_#x2F;ios</a>.  Our docs are the first experience developers will have with Layer.<p>We care about design.  We won’t be releasing our own apps - that’s up to our customers - but we’ll be open sourcing beautiful example apps that build on our SDKs.<p>We care about security and privacy.  Securing the transport is only the first step.  When we don’t have the keys we can’t access the data.  (In theory.  Security is hard.)<p>Today we_#x27;re a team of engineers and designers passionate about communications. We’re on a mission to make communications better through every product -- mobile or web -- that people use and love.  We hold the power to dramatically improve the way 2 billion+ Internet users communicate.<p>We’re well funded and have already assembled an early team that shows we mean business. We’ve started and built world-class companies and highly scalable Internet infrastructure and invented protocols used by millions.<p>Get in touch: jobs at layer dot com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6833688 href="vote?for=6833688_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%70%58%38%37%4c%61%53%35%58%50%77%42%67%58%79%4f%35%39%6e%4a%6d%70"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6833688></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sokratisp">sokratisp</a> 154 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6833688">link</a></span></div><br>

You_#x27;ll have real influence on the product, strategy, team and culture with the freedom and responsibility to turn plans and ideas into reality.<p>We believe that you need to work when and how you’re most productive to deliver results, so we have flexible work hours and don’t count your days off (and insist you take at least 22 of them per year).<p>You_#x27;ll help define our company culture and decide what perks would interest you - conference_#x2F;travel budget, ideal workstation setup, free lunch...?<p>We want our team to share in the success of the company, so you can choose a combination of cash and equity to suit your financial situation.<p>If you_#x27;re not in London, but are happy to move here from somewhere else in the UK_#x2F;Europe, then we_#x27;ll help you with expenses, finding accommodation and settling in.<p>To apply please send us an email at jobs@togethera.com with a bit about yourself and products you’ve built.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6828196 href="vote?for=6828196_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%70%58%38%37%4c%61%53%35%58%50%77%42%67%58%79%4f%35%39%6e%4a%6d%70"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6828196></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dave1010uk">dave1010uk</a> 155 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6828196">link</a></span></div><br>

We need help supporting that load.<p>Keen IO is a fully managed cloud API that lets developers build complex, hyper-custom, large-scale analytics and data science features directly into their web, mobile, or Internet of Things applications.<p>Our currency is event data, and events are a pretty broad abstraction. Every time someone draws a breath, clicks a link, loads a website, pauses a song, or starts a car, there_#x27;s an event. Events like these, in large aggregate, are extremely useful -- and therefore valuable :)<p>It_#x27;s probably worth mentioning that we_#x27;re a platform company, not a product company. This means our customers are using the platform to build for an emergent and rapidly growing set of use cases. The same flexibility that makes us future-proof for a given customer also makes us future-proof from a market perspective. So while a product company seeks a certain kind of product-market fit, we allow product-market fit to come to us: our customers build it for themselves.<p>Things we look for in a new team member:<p><pre><code>  • Learning agility 
  • Abstract reasoning 
  • Empathy
  • Potential is more important than credential 
  • Confidence, but tempered by humility _amp; the drive to get even better
</code></pre>
Some things we believe in:<p><pre><code>  • Mission = The Discovery of Truth.
  • Radical transparency 
  • Design with a capital _quot;D_quot; 
  • Introspection 
  • Distributed innovation 
  • The importance of laughter 
  • Relationships are everything 
  • Play to your strengths; patch your weaknesses with diverse collaborators

You are self-disciplined, self-directed, but also detail-oriented in your communication about what choices you make and what you are doing.<p>Likeable Local offers an integrated software solution that allows small businesses to create, enhance and manage their social media presence. Likeable Local was founded in 2012 and has a deployed product that integrates with Facebook and Twitter. The software is sold on a subscription basis, allowing for attractive recurring revenue economics, and is in use by dentists, dry cleaners, florists, and jewelers and we continue to expand.<p>Interested?

  * we’re well funded (we just raised a $2M seed round) and have had paying clients since day 1 of the company 

  * we’re hiring designers and all types of devs -- mobile, frontend, backend, analytics 

  * we think even enterprise software can be beautiful, and pride ourselves on our design 

  * every single one of our developers have committed code within their first day at work; some within their first hour
</code></pre>
Here’s some stuff we’ve been working on lately:<p><pre><code>  * building infrastructure to allow us to scale our video recording and streaming

  * re-building the UI-heavy sections of our product using AngularJS

  * designing and creating our mobile suite for both job candidates and employers alike 

  * presenting analytics data captured in our product to the end user, and our team internally
</code></pre>
We use Python_#x2F;Django, JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS), ActionScript, MySQL (and some MongoDB), but you’d be free to choose your own tools and libraries. If this sounds fun, let’s chat! My name is Konrad, and you can send me a note at konrad@kiratalent.com. :)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6883231 href="vote?for=6883231_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%70%58%38%37%4c%61%53%35%58%50%77%42%67%58%79%4f%35%39%6e%4a%6d%70"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6883231></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jik">jik</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6883231">link</a></span></div><br>

You decide the technology  - The engineer who_#x27;s writing the code has the final vote on which technologies get used. We use APIs to cross-connect our projects with ease, which also enables us to use different languages in different projects.
Flexible work hours - come in as early or late as you want, as long as your total hours are on par with your peers; what really matters is the quality and quantity of your code commits.
Code intelligently - We hack, but we also care about sharing code with each other, so we talk about readability and complexity, we develop all modules as though they_#x27;ll one day be open-sourced, and we believe in small tools used cleverly, at scale.
Open Source friendly-  Besides using mostly open-source tools, we_#x27;ve open-sourced several internally developed tools on <a href="https://github.com/MakerStudios/" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;github.com_#x2F;MakerStudios_#x2F;</a>, and more are coming.
Great benefits - We have amazing investors and we want healthy, enthusiastic employees, so we offer our engineers a highly competitive salary, top-notch health_#x2F;dental_#x2F;vision coverage, 401(k), and stock options.<p>Inquiries:  geoffrey.plitt@makerstudios.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6827869 href="vote?for=6827869_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%70%58%38%37%4c%61%53%35%58%50%77%42%67%58%79%4f%35%39%6e%4a%6d%70"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6827869></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zmb">zmb</a> 155 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6827869">link</a></span></div><br>

* Encouraging and rewarding results, not number of hours
* Building a product where we can be proud of both the purpose and the technology
* Putting users and their needs first
* Investing in good development tools<p>We’re not picky about particular technologies, but we’d like you to have the ability to quickly learn whatever languages and frameworks we throw at you (that said, python skills are a plus). Ideally you live in either San Francisco, where our dev team is based, or Los Angeles, where the rest of the crew works from a pretty sweet studio overlooking Venice Beach. And if you have a solid track record and great references, we’re cool with having you work remotely.<p>Apply by sending links to your latest projects and a short email or cover letter about why you want to join SUPRMASV to hiring@supermassive.io.

Founded in 2011, Likely is at the forefront of social media data collection and analysis having helped companies such as Coca-Cola and the British Government develop highly engaging, relevant presences online.<p>We analyse billions of social interactions – such as follows, shares and comments – to better understand how people cluster around things they are passionate about. By looking at brands as a collection of “passion points”, we have found that it is significantly easier to discover the people that are most likely to engage with a brand’s content and understand what content will resonate most with them.<p>We_#x27;re looking for:
Software Developers. We have a sophisticated Clojure data engine at the core of our business that has been built according to Lambda Architecture principles on top of AWS. This excellent foundation drives our data business, our client work and powers our products. We are looking for developers to join our talented team to help us reap the rewards of this architecture with further data-driven products as we scale our business.<p>A front-end focused Developer. We are looking to enhance our front end capability with an experienced front end developer. This is fantastic opportunity to develop responsive, highly visual applications which present our company_#x27;s primary asset - our insights - to our customers. You will be working on our new products and will have the opportunity to develop and shape our front end capabilities from the ground up.<p>Both roles will be working closely with the CTO but will be given the responsibility and flexibility to design and build systems as part of a small, highly focused development team. In return we offer:<p>• A competitive basic salary<p>• 10% of time dedicated to hack-day projects<p>• An excellent working environment with ample opportunity for progression<p>• Open to flexible working<p>• 30 days holidays per year<p>• A company commitment to quality technology and external training<p>Please email henry@likely.co (yes, just .co!) or contact us through our website.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6829286 href="vote?for=6829286_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%79%30%4b%36%4f%68%33%59%78%34%79%59%49%77%6e%59%63%69%64%35%48%6f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_6829286></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=DustinCalim">DustinCalim</a> 155 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6829286">link</a></span></div><br>

Innovating on our top ranked mobile apps
