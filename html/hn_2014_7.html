The only problem there is that as container ships get larger, the variability in the global supply chain goes up (e.g. a large ship being late causes a headache to more people than a small one).<p>How we fix it -_gt; We track every ship on the water and run a bunch of analysis on our data sets so that we can help our customers smooth out the rough edges.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Bloomberg - San Francisco (full-time, no remote, no relo, visa ok)<p>I am looking for the first few individuals to join a team of two building something special in SF. Bootstrapping a team from scratch requires a type of person who thrives in a startup atmosphere and can wear many hats. Ideal candidates have had plenty of experience scaling up or building large distributed systems and_#x2F;or building products for developers with a large user base. Full-time Bloomberg LP employment with generous benefits and compensation commensurate with experience.<p>Who we are:<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion _quot;ticks_quot; daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one _quot;feed_quot;) from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, machine translation, etc. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, Government, Law, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>If you want to join a team in the single digits and work for one of the most profitable software companies in the world, contact me -- andrew@ishiboo.com (personal e-mail)</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7970539" href="vote?for=7970539_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%39%37%30%33%36%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7970539"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7970539">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">TechEmpower - Los Angeles area, California (El Segundo, near LAX)<p>You may recognize us from the Web Framework Benchmarks that have been discussed on HN periodically: <a href="http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.techempower.com_#x2F;benchmarks_#x2F;</a><p>We don_#x27;t want ninjas and rockstars, just good developers<p>We hire people, not skill sets. If you_#x27;re a smart, motivated developer who likes our company culture, let_#x27;s talk.<p>Over the past 16 years we_#x27;ve cultivated a great group of people to work with. Our developers are smart, thoughtful, respectful to each other, opinionated, dedicated, and fun. We don_#x27;t hire often, and when we do, we value these qualities as much as technical abilities.<p>Founded by a former computer science professor, in many ways we keep the same feel as a small computer science lab (without the long hours):<p><pre><code>    Challenging and varied projects
    Informal, comfortable environment
    Intelligent, engaged people
    Lively, respectful technology discussions
    Frequent mentoring
    Easy camaraderie
    General culture of helpfulness and friendliness 
</code></pre>
Teams at TechEmpower are typically between 2 and 6 people. Because of the small size of our teams, we need developers able to work on all aspects of an application (_quot;full stack_quot; developers). We rely on individual developers to do much of the software design, with guidance and discussion, and actively work to improve each other_#x27;s technical capabilities.<p>On average, a typical developer will get exposure to 3 or 4 different projects over the course of a year. Since each project has a different technology stack, developers gain varied experience over time and never stop learning.<p>We pride ourselves on doing the best work we can for our clients. This means working with them to really understand what they need built, carefully planning how to do it, and delivering what we promise while maintaining a sensible work_#x2F;life balance. We build quality applications and have fun doing it.<p>Also, we enjoy programming on high-performance workstations with 4K displays. A lot of code fits in 3840x2160 pixels!<p>The technologies we use vary over time with our mix of projects. Here is a snapshot of the technologies we use at the moment:<p><pre><code>    Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP
    Tools: Git, Jenkins (Continuous Integration), Sonar (static code analysis), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven
    Web: Dropwizard, .NET MVC 5, Play, Django, Rails, Mustache, Handlebars, Backbone, Angular, Knockout, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.
    Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap
    Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), Rackspace Cloud, Linux deployments
    Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, NoSQL (Redis, MongoDB) 
</code></pre>
We don_#x27;t expect new hires to have experience with all of these, but developers at TechEmpower can expect to expand their skillsets with most of these over time.<p>If this sounds like the kind of place you_#x27;d like to work, please apply here:

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">London, UK<p>Fully funded PhD Studentship in Space Debris Environment Modelling using Spatio-Temporal Analysis<p>University College London<p>=============<p>Although largely unrecognised by the general population, the world has never been more reliant on access to space. However, continued use of the space environment over the last 60 years has polluted the orbits around the Earth with debris. Currently only a small fraction of space debris is tracked. Failure to capture this data more accurately, and model its behaviour, could result in us losing access to space entirely if a space debris cascade event is allowed to occur.<p>The aim of this PhD project is to describe the current space debris environment using cutting edge astrodynamics methods and model its evolution over time using machine learning techniques and spatio-temporal data analysis. The Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory (SGNL) has become a world leader in accurately modelling the many forces acting on spacecraft in orbit. Our models are currently employed by both NASA and ESA to supply data to support scientific environmental monitoring missions (JASON-1, SENTINEL). SpaceTimeLab have a wealth of experience in the analysis, modelling, simulation and visualisation of large spatio-temporal datasets, with applications in transportation, crime and disaster response. This is an exciting opportunity to build on these models and develop novel techniques to gain new insights into the behaviour of the space debris environment.<p>Skills you will learn include design, development and testing of algorithms, software and database development, experimental design and implementation, data analysis and both technical and interpersonal communication. You will also have the opportunity to build a network of contacts within both the astrodynamics and spatio-temporal data analysis communities.<p>This project is a collaboration between UCL’s Space Geodesy and Navigation Laboratory and SpaceTimeLab and will be supervised by Dr Stuart Grey and Dr James Haworth.<p>Eligibility: Applications are invited from UK and EU members, residing in UK.<p>Application Procedure: Applicants should send a covering letter and CV to s.grey@ucl.ac.uk<p>Start Date: The post will be available from September 2014<p>Duration: 4 Years<p>Funding: The scholarship covers UCL registration fees and provides a stipend of £15,726 per annum tax free. Travel expenses and research equipment will also be paid for.<p>Funding Body:EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council)</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7970770" href="vote?for=7970770_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%39%37%30%33%36%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7970770"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=trefn">trefn</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7970770">link</a></span></div><br>

Mixpanel (YCS09; <a href="http://mixpanel.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;mixpanel.com</a>) is the most advanced advanced analytics platform ever for web _amp; mobile applications.<p>Mixpanel is profitable, with thousands of customers and millions in monthly revenue.<p>ENGINEERING CULTURE<p>Our engineering culture:<p><pre><code>  * We do very thorough, line-by-line code reviews using GitHub pull requests. This keeps our code quality high and helps us learn.
  * We try to have two people work together on every project (collaborating, not pairing). It_#x27;s more fun and it results in better code.
  * We practice rapid iteration. If it_#x27;s better than live, we ship. We also build things so they can go live (whitelisted) long before launch day.
  * We write tests for things that are mission-critical, prone to failure, or cause paranoia. Think billing and datastore code, not Django views.
  * We care about learning. Right now we_#x27;re reading through Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment.
  * We currently have 9 vim users, 2 IntelliJ, and 1 emacs holdout.
</code></pre>
ENGINEERING POSITIONS<p>We have two types of engineering positions available - systems and product. Both of these positions require you to be able to work in San Francisco, CA.<p>Systems engineers build and scale our infrastructure, and write mostly C, C++, and Python. We are working on a number of new products right now with serious infrastructure challenges and we need more people with great depth to help us solve them. This position requires at least 4 years of experience.<p>Responsibilities of this role include:<p><pre><code>  * Working on our custom datastore (written from the ground up in C)
  * Scaling the data processing pipeline (currently handling _gt; 50K requests per second)
  * Building notification delivery infrastructure (currently sending _gt; 100M emails _amp; push notifications per month)
  * General improvements to performance, reliability, and security
  * Work with the rest of the engineering team to design, build, deploy, and maintain systems
</code></pre>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">hi Matt,
Hall sounds like a great company to work for.<p>I am an experienced software developer looking for opportunities in the Bay area. I am currently working at Qualcomm- Modem software division. At this point in my career, I really want to break into the mobile _#x2F; web development, but it has proven not easy- given that my experience is primarily with firmware _#x2F; embedded device programming.<p>I do, however,  have a strong foundation in CS fundamentals: algorithms, data structures, good coding practices. I also have a lot of experience in all aspects of the software development life cycle (requirements, design, implementation and testing), having implemented and maintained high-quality software that are deployed on billions of mobile devices around the world.<p>I have taken initiatives on my own to learn about web and mobile development. Last summer, I took Startup Engineering class on Coursera which taught front-end and back-end technologies, built a website on my own in a month (~10,000 lines of code), earned a place in the final projects rankings, and a distinction for passing the class at 97% grade. I am also signing up for Android programming class on the same platform.<p>I am an extremely fast learner and am eager to learn whatever necessary, including new languages and technologies, to get the jobs done.<p>Please let me know if you are interested. You can reach me at 858-405-8831 or hugh.hn@gmail.com</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7973576" href="vote?for=7973576_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%39%37%30%33%36%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7973576"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=flylib">flylib</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7973576">link</a></span></div><br>

We’re very early so you really get to own this piece of the product. You’ll work closely with product, front end engineers, mobile engineers, and firmware engineers to develop an API that talks to both our marketplace as well as our printers. Being self-driven is important since the team is small and we want to build an ambitious product quickly.<p>Preferably Ruby_#x2F;Rails, but we are early enough that you can pretty much build it out the way you want. You should have strong experience developing large-scale web applications and experience designing and building REST APIs.<p>* Senior Software Engineer - Front End *<p>We are also looking for engineer to lead the development of the front end of the marketplace. We’re very early so you really get to own this piece of the product. You’ll work closely with product and design to implement the best possible user experience across both desktop and mobile.<p>An ideal candidate would be up to date on current best practices for developing complex user interfaces, including front end frameworks and communicating with REST APIs. Being self-driven is important since the team is small and we want to build an ambitious product quickly. You should have strong experience developing large-scale web applications (desktop and mobile web), experience with modern web frameworks (such as Backbone, Angular, Ember, etc), experience working with REST APIs, and, obviously, experience with and extensive knowledge of web technologies (HTML5_#x2F;CSS3_#x2F;Javascript).

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">We’re a YC company building financial services tools. We_#x27;re already cash-flow positive, and laptops, and office snacks, and etc. and so forth. and general good things. Here_#x27;s what_#x27;s awesome: we have non-technical customers paying us for an online tool. Everyday, our clients call and email to say that we_#x27;re making them happy. And that feels great.<p>But there_#x27;s one problem: parts of our product are a little bit ugly and a little bit confusing. We_#x27;re rapidly adding new features, and we_#x27;re quickly outpacing our design capabilities. In short, it’s time to hire a UX_#x2F;UI designer.<p>Our clients use our product for hours at a time. This is their tool for getting their jobs done. It is their workflow. We want it to beautiful and intuitive. It should be easy for a new client to learn, while at the same time, it should make power users feel like they’re flying through their day.<p>You must have experience with The Struggle of Application Design. And frankly, you should enjoy this struggle, because it’s hard to get things right, but really rewarding when you do.<p>What would your first day on the job be like? Well, we’ve got a product live right now that processes several hundred orders per day. You now own the design and you will be responsible for improving it. Changes could be simple, like, ‘make this button blue’ or it could be more elaborate like, ‘add tooltips and a new customer tutorial,’ or maybe you might want to redesign aspects of the site from scratch. Ideally, within a couple weeks, clients should be telling us that they’ve noticed small, nice design improvements.<p>List of Responsibilities: - Design - Usability and Utility are more important (at the moment) than purely visual appeal. As a team, we frequently meet with our clients to learn how they’re using the product. A good candidate for this role will be able to speak to users and feel out their feelings.<p>List of Skills: - UI_#x2F;UX design experience - Responsive design experience (a lot of our clients access our site on their phones) - HTML_#x2F;CSS is great. At the moment, we’re using a lot of Bootstrap. Pixel perfect designs are not (yet) crucial; usability is paramount.<p>We’re in San Francisco on a trolley-filled street in Union Square. We’re small (3 in-office employees) and we’re still building a culture. If you have ideas for how to build a blissed-out company, we’re all ears. Thinking of moving to San Francisco, but not yet ready to commit? Talk to us.<p>Send an email to fintechw14@gmail.com telling us about yourself.

    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http:_#x2F;_#x2F;grmakers.com), which gives us access
    to lots of cool machines.

A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
    Just look here: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;beeradvocate.com_#x2F;beerfly_#x2F;city_#x2F;43

  - If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

Clever (YC S12 - <a href="https://clever.com" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;clever.com</a>) is building the data platform needed for great software to make its way into the classroom. Just like Stripe has made it simple for developers to build payment processing into their apps, Clever has made it easy for developers to build applications for schools using student data.<p>We_#x27;re a small, highly technical team with deep experience in education. In under two years, 1 in 7 schools in America has begun using our APIs, meaning that Clever moves data for eight million students every day.<p>Our newest project is essentially Facebook Connect for education: one identity to tie together all of a student’s learning applications into a cohesive experience.  We’re making that happen with our Instant Login service, which allows students to log in once and immediately get access to all their apps: <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/n/2014-05-14-no-more-passwords-clever-shows-off-instant-login" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.edsurge.com_#x2F;n_#x2F;2014-05-14-no-more-passwords-cleve...</a><p>And while we have all the startup perks (a beautiful loft office in SoMa, free lunch, unlimited Amazon credits for learning..) – hands down the best part of the job are the calls and emails from schools describing how much Clever helps them.<p>As an education company, we’re all about learning personally too – it’s practically a prerequisite to work here. In the past few weeks we’ve done tech talks on things like exoplanets, set theory, and kitesurfing.  (We also love a good round of bughouse chess – just ask Magnus Carlsen <a href="http://screencast.com/t/xD7umWfo" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;screencast.com_#x2F;t_#x2F;xD7umWfo</a>)<p>We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">_quot;Given that the Gnome foundation ran out of money because they diverted donations to women_#x27;s outreach, rather than focusing on the core mission of programming_quot;<p>This is, shockingly, incorrect:<p>1) The GNOME Foundation did not run out of money.
2) The reason for the financial issues was not that money from donations was diverted to women_#x27;s outreach - instead, corporate donations that were intended specifically for OPW were not received before outgoings to students were due. Money from existing reserves was used to cover the shortfall, most of which has now been made up as the original donations have been received.
3) The GNOME Foundation_#x27;s charter does not define a core mission of programming. One of its roles is to promote development of the GNOME platform, and recruiting developers from a pool that_#x27;s been largely ignored by the free software community is an excellent way to do that.<p>That_#x27;s three fundamental factual errors in 25 words.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7974233" href="vote?for=7974233_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%39%37%30%33%36%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7974233"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=darthgoogle">darthgoogle</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7974233">link</a></span></div><br>

Instead of waiting for the corporate downations to arrive, they prioritised the women_#x27;s outreach program over everything else.<p>As for the GNOME charter, _quot;The GNOME Foundation will work to further the goal of the GNOME project: to create a computing platform for use by the general public that is completely free software._quot;<p>Nowhere does it say that the GNOME foundation is going into the business of diversity outreach.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Running out of money would imply that there was, well, no money. Which was never the case. The Foundation has significant cash reserves, as you can easily verify from looking at its public accounts.<p>The outreach program has resulted in a significant increase in the number of developers working on the GNOME project, which improves their ability to build the GNOME platform. The charter doesn_#x27;t say that they_#x27;ll sponsor developer travel to conferences either, or the purchase of hardware in order to improve integration.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Employment law only covers so much. For one, people are still discriminated against on the basis of their belonging to a protected class - it just can_#x27;t be done overtly. For another the laws don_#x27;t cover everything.<p>I appreciate that you feel the phrasing is antagonistic; but I hope you can appreciate that to me it is deeply reassuring and gives me much needed hope.<p>Searching for employment for me is very stressful (as it is for most people I imagine). I_#x27;m non-typical in a few ways, and some of them are rather visible. I have to worry about and have experienced judgment_#x2F;reluctance to hire me based on those differences. It is nice for me to know ahead of time that an employer is not just looking for people who fit a certain mold.<p>It_#x27;s not just about women, LGBTQ, people of color, etc either. One of the ways I am somewhat non-typical as a developer is I_#x27;m a high school dropout. It_#x27;s relatively common for developers not to have a college_#x2F;university education, but overall it_#x27;s still not the norm and there are places that will discount you on that basis (especially outside the major tech hubs). Sure, a lot of postings will add that nice qualifier _quot;or equivalent experience_quot;; and that_#x27;s great. This goes a little farther though, and lets me know that not only will they not hold my lack of a piece of paper against me, they won_#x27;t hold my alternate path in life against me either.<p>I can appreciate that it might seem like it goes without saying to you, or might ring hollow... but honestly I_#x27;ve found there are places that <i>don_#x27;t</i> care about diversity_#x2F;inclusiveness, or are even hostile to it. Also, I do actually appreciate just the effort of hanging that little sign that says _quot;this is a welcoming place_quot;.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7972896" href="vote?for=7972896_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%39%37%30%33%36%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7972896"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=glenda">glenda</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7972896">link</a></span></div><br>

Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another.

On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user. We use d3, Backbone, and some CoffeeScript today, but you_#x27;d be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>We_#x27;re a rapidly growing startup (you_#x27;d be #18), but well funded ($6M) and have customers at places like Harvard, Caltech, UCSF, and Stanford.

Our fundraising and compliance software is used by the vast majority of Democratic candidates from the Presidential level on down, and our fast-growing new media platform has recently become the most-used platform by Democratic campaigns as well.<p>We have a several spots open in DC - most of them (management and devops) are focused on our public facing products that run on a combination of node, angular, mongo, dynamo, drupal, and a touch of ruby now, with a senior developer spot for our asp.net mvc, ef, and angular stack.<p>The positions offers competitive compensation and a strong benefits package.

We have developed a computational platform that can predict how a potential drug will behave in the lab and the body. We use this platform to process large spaces of chemistry while searching for therapies for some of the world’s most important diseases, such as, obesity, heart failure, Alzheimer’s, and Huntington’s disease. Our platform makes the drug development process cheaper, faster, and results in higher success rates than traditional approaches.<p>--- Our Stack ---<p>Our stack consists of a proprietary distributed computational platform, Numatix, which in-turn consists of cloud management, job management, job execution engine and custom dataflow language layers. We generally run this on top of Amazon Web Services, where we often scale the system to more than 10,000 cores. We are working to scale it to over 100,000 cores. On top of Numatix we run a number of custom libraries and services, such as machine learning, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, mathematics, etc. At the very top of our stack sits a number of user-facing tools, including web-based GUIs, NIX command line tools, and custom plugins for third party data analysis and chemistry tools. All of the layers use various storage types (MySQL, S3, Couchbase, custom built). The code base is written in Java, Scala, Python, and some C++. All of these layers are being actively developed and improved.<p>Join us, and code for more than just clicks!<p>For more information see <a href="https://github.com/Numerate/hiring" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;github.com_#x2F;Numerate_#x2F;hiring</a> or shoot us an email to eng_job@numerate.com</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_8036253" href="vote?for=8036253_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%39%37%30%33%36%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_8036253"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rodw">rodw</a> 7 days ago  | <a href="item?id=8036253">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">South Lake Tahoe (Zephyr Cove, NV) Informa Investment Solutions, Inc. is seeking both a senior and a junior developer to join our web applications team at our office on the shores of Lake Tahoe. If you love designing and building modern, responsive web applications that make it easy for business users to run sophisticated investment analysis software, we would like to talk to you. We’re an established company with actual paying customers and we want to make our little corner of the world a better place for our users.<p>We use standards-based HTML, JavaScript and CSS, along with state of the art technologies – Canvas, SVG, RequireJS, Backbone, Marionette, and LESS – to build cross-browser interfaces and advanced data visualizations. The backend is a mixture of C#, Java, C++ because we believe in using the right tool for the job, and we are regularly evaluating our tools to ensure that. Our development process is agile and we release our web products approximately once a month.<p>Our offices are a five minute walk from the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe and Heavenly ski resort is a fifteen minute drive from the office. As a developer you’ll also get your own private office and even though we mostly develop on Windows, all our developers have Mac hardware. We prefer to hire generalists who are as curious and excited about technology as we are. All of us enjoy learning new technologies and tools; we have a small team and each developer should be able to work on every aspect of the system.<p>Please note: this is a full-time, on-site position. We would prefer you to work in our Zephyr Cove office, but we also have offices in White Plains, NY or Nashville, TN that you could work out of. If you_#x27;re interested, please email matt.motherway -at- informais.com (and put “Hacker News” in the subject).

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">PHP_#x2F;Back end or Front-End Developer INTERN - Washington DC<p>The agency I work for, Engage (<a href="http://enga.ge" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;enga.ge</a>), is looking for fall developer interns. We do everything from WordPress sites to our own products to custom web and mobile apps, and most of our work relates to politics_#x2F;issue advocacy. We_#x27;re particularly passionate about Internet issues (anti-SOPA advocacy was a big pro bono project for us). Right now we_#x27;re gearing up to launch a new product so it_#x27;s a pretty exciting time. Check out our portfolio here: <a href="http://enga.ge/work/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;enga.ge_#x2F;work_#x2F;</a>.<p>Anyway, we are looking for a college student with back or front-end talent (PHP_#x2F;MySQL or Javascript_#x2F;HTML_#x2F;CSS). Must be in the DC area or willing to relocate; foreigners welcome as long as you can secure a visa on your own (usually J-1 or F-1).<p>Also, note that we treat our interns well and hire them. In fact, one of our current developers used to intern here, as did I. And, management doesn_#x27;t really care if you have side projects, which is always nice.<p>To apply, please send me an email directly to michele@engagedc.com with the subject _quot;Developer intern from Hacker News_quot; (I_#x27;m the technical project manager). Include your resume, GitHub_#x2F;portfolio link and a brief description of why you want to work with us. Hope to hear from you!</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr style="height:10px"></tr><tr><td class="title"><a href="/x?fnid=nE0MObMCEJX4YPMRlZwulq" rel="nofollow">More</a></td></tr></table><br><br>

We have a variety of interesting and challenging projects. Our team works with complex regression models, time series models, high-dimensional data, text parsers and statistical classifiers, and the sheer amount of data we collect means that there are countless hypotheses to investigate and test.<p>How we work:<p>==========<p>While our company is amongst the best in the world at what we do, and consequently has grown rapidly over the past years, we’ve retained the feel of a start-up: you manage your own time and have your say on what we do.<p>You’ll get a competitive salary that is reviewed regularly, with an annual bonus option. We have free fruit, snacks, Nespresso and catered lunches and dinners every day; fun social get-togethers; our own 5-a-side football teams; as well as clubs for running and cycling. And you get to choose your own development kit.<p>SOFTWARE ENGINEER (full-time, permanent, on-site)<p>======================================<p>We’re looking for an experienced programmer to help us build real-time trading software, work with large datasets, do complex statistical modelling and invent new ways to help our staff analyse football. You will be working mainly with the modelling department, in close cooperation with our statisticians and football experts, building the infrastructure and the foundations of our models.<p>The main language we use for our real-time and modelling systems is Scala, but we use Python and PHP too. We don_#x27;t expect you to know Scala, but we expect that you will be excited to learn it if you don_#x27;t know it already.<p>You should have mastered at least one compiled object-orientated language, have worked on at least one big software project, and feel comfortable working autonomously on designing_#x2F;building large scale maintainable and testable systems.<p>JUNIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEER (full-time, permanent, on-site)<p>============================================<p>We_#x27;re looking for an engineer who can write structured, testable code for our web applications. You should have experience of object-oriented programming in PHP and one other language. You should also have some practical experience of building and maintaining commercial applications. Ideally you_#x27;ll have some experience of working with MVC frameworks and especially Symfony2 components.<p>You should have a good Computer Science degree, or similar. We will happily consider applications from candidates with other educational backgrounds, but we will expect you to demonstrate strong knowledge of computer science fundamentals to an equivalent standard.<p>JAVASCRIPT DEVELOPER (full-time, permanent, on-site)<p>========================================<p>The ideal candidate will be experienced in frontend development, with experience working with rich user interfaces and single-page applications. We are scaling up our business operations, and we need someone who can create powerful interfaces that help us grow.<p>We need developers with a keen understanding of browser performance and the unique constraints of rendering high volumes of data in realtime. Demonstrable experience of modular design and event-driven architecture is also highly desirable.<p>Some of the technologies that power Football Radar:<p>* Backbone, Marionette, React, jQuery<p>* AMD (Require.js), CommonJS (Browserify_#x2F;Webpack)<p>* Grunt, Bower, NPM<p>* Node.js<p>* Mocha, Nodeunit, Istanbul, PhantomJS</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7972651" href="vote?for=7972651_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6e%45%30%4d%4f%62%4d%43%45%4a%58%34%59%50%4d%52%6c%5a%77%75%6c%71"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7972651"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=infer">infer</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7972651">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;re a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over £500 million of bets. Smarkets has been featured in publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.<p>We_#x27;re building a reliable, low-latency exchange system to facilitate automated traded strategies, as well as a fast, modern web interface. Our team constantly works on significant, challenging software engineering problems; if you_#x27;re fed up of writing yet another boring CMS, we might be able to help. The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques and REST. We make extensive use of version control, configuration management and automated testing, which allows us to reliably deploy code to production several times a day.<p>Our team builds on a modern, open-source software stack which includes Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, Graphite, Chef and Git.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do _quot;expense reports that don_#x27;t suck!_quot; (Google _quot;expensify_quot; to read more.) We_#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren_#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it_#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won_#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn_#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We_#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We_#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing_#x2F;designing_#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you_#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you_#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you_#x27;re this sort of person, you_#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn_#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That_#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it_#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I_#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don_#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href="http://we.are.expensify.com/apply" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;we.are.expensify.com_#x2F;apply</a>). We are excited to hear from you!

NationBuilder is an online Community Organizing System built by a world-class team dedicated to empowering a new generation of leaders and creators with the tools they need to create a new world.<p>We’re currently hiring great software developers to join our core and web systems teams in Los Angeles.  We will relocate folks, so if you’ve ever wanted to live in LA, this is probably the best opportunity you’ll get. (And if you never considered living in LA we’ll convince you that it’s the greatest city to live in.)<p>Our driving force as a company is to empower organizers to make the world a better place, and we do this by creating a powerful product with a great customer experience.<p>As a team we are dedicated to continuous learning and improvement.  We will push code within minutes of a customer reporting a problem, and our entire process is set up for rapid iteration and agile development.<p>On our core and web systems teams, you will build, extend, refactor, and scale the core parts of our product. From systems that form a content management system for websites, to a comprehensive control panel for relationship and contact management, to scalable integrations with domain management and email systems -- you will be responsible for keeping NationBuilder running well, becoming better and faster, and achieving our mission. Your skills will need to be balanced between the front-end and the back-end, as you will cross layers from the database to JavaScript in order to develop new features. Your troubleshooting skills will allow you to drill down from a bug report to a solution regardless of complexity. You will work with the product management team to develop delightful, usable, fast, and maintainable features that solve real customer needs.<p>You:<p>are always interested in learning new things.<p>get excited when you have the chance to pair.<p>practice test-driven development and judicious refactoring.<p>enjoy being responsive to customer feedback.<p>are a pragmatic problem solver, knowing how to find the middle ground between “perfect, but takes forever to code” and “fixes it now, but nobody will ever be able to understand what I did”<p>work well in small teams with a clear mission.<p>detail oriented and precise in code, communication, and documentation.<p>have the insight to know what’s important and the dedication to get it done.<p>Skills required:<p>While existing experience with the technologies we use is welcome, an open and disciplined approach to your work is more important to us than whether you already know Ruby, Rails or anything else in our stack.

Fantasy Sports is a booming industry that is growing every year and has one of the most passionate and engaged users on the web.<p>We have several positions that we are currently trying to hire for as we try to bring home the championship. Sports and fantasy knowledge is a plus, but not required. Just a willingness to get a little crazy and watch sports! Watching sports will be a part of your job, how cool is that? Here is what we are hiring for:<p>1. Data Scientist - We have some of the largest warehouses of both user generated and sports data anywhere. This is a sports nuts_#x27; dream! Apply for this if you love figuring out what users are doing and how to iterate on the product based on numbers.<p>2. Backend engineer - We are creating a new, state of the art backend infrastructure. Fantasy Sports is one of the most challenging backends on the web, due to the spiky nature of traffic. During an NFL Sunday, our peak RPS can exceed twitter! Apply for this if you love massive scaling and performance optimization.<p>3. Mobile engineer - Looking for both iOS and Android expertise. I was acquired by Yahoo last year (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/01/yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a-one-man-fantasy-sports-app-maker/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;techcrunch.com_#x2F;2013_#x2F;07_#x2F;01_#x2F;yahoo-acquires-bignoggins-a...</a>), and my goal is to make Yahoo Fantasy Sports the runaway leader in mobile sports apps. We have a great team of designers and developers, and Yahoo mobile is actually now the largest mobile development organization in the world! We are taking mobile seriously, and you can help us get there.<p>4. SDET - For fantasy sports, we can NOT make mistakes. No fumbles, no turnovers, nothing. Our crack team of SDETs writes automated test scripts and build testing and release infrastructure to make sure that the devs can move fast and (not) break things!<p>Yahoo may not be the most glamorous company in the Valley, and we definitely don_#x27;t have it all figured out. Most startups let you make a big impact in a small pond, and a big company lets you make a small impact in a big pond. Yahoo is the rare opportunity to make a big impact in a big pond. There is a lot of low hanging fruit that we need to solve, and if you want to be part of one of the most epic turnaround stories in the Valley, then hit me up!<p>If you wanna come kick ass and chew bubble gum, hit me up at bignoggins@yahoo-inc.com!</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7971754" href="vote?for=7971754_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6e%45%30%4d%4f%62%4d%43%45%4a%58%34%59%50%4d%52%6c%5a%77%75%6c%71"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7971754"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=andrewforee">andrewforee</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7971754">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">PSYCHOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES (<a href="http://PSYT.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;PSYT.co.uk</a>) — Epsom_#x2F;Brighton, UK<p>* Seeking: experienced Android and_#x2F;or full stack engineer<p>WHAT WE DO.  We’re a tech startup creating corporate and consumer products to measure and enhance wellbeing and productivity. There are two strands to what we do. First, we quantify cognitive and psychological states, such as attention or happiness. Second, we deliver interventions, such as mindfulness, to boost cognitive and psychological skills. Web and mobile apps are key to both these strands.<p>WHO WE ARE.  Our backgrounds span finance, psychology, technology, and design. CTO George leads on the measurement side, having mapped the nation’s wellbeing with the Mappiness app (<a href="http://mappiness.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;mappiness.org.uk</a>). CEO Nick leads on interventions, as the former Head of Research for successful mindfulness app Headspace (<a href="http://www.getsomeheadspace.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.getsomeheadspace.com</a>).<p>WHAT WE USE.  We love CoffeeScript, both in the browser and for our internal app logic. Our back-end is largely Postgres and Ruby. We could imagine using Node, Python, Go and_#x2F;or R at some point; maybe other things too. Our iOS apps are C and Objective-C, of course, with liberal use of SpriteKit and Accelerate. We’ve tried RubyMotion (impressive, but probably not for us) and we’re playing with Swift. Our Android apps don’t exist yet, and that might be where you come in.<p>WHO YOU MIGHT BE.  We’re looking for someone smart, opinionated, and enthusiastic (in the face of interesting work). Someone with solid experience in web, Android (especially) and_#x2F;or iOS app development, who likes learning, and who agrees that UX is the most important — and usually the hardest — thing to get right. Bonus points for any of: user testing, sysadmin or database expertise; an interesting technical blog or Github_#x2F;BitBucket profile; and an interest in mindfulness or subjective wellbeing.<p>WHERE WE’RE AT.  Geographically we’re currently at Nuffield Health_#x27;s offices in Epsom (free gym and lovely offices) but a move to Brighton is likely in the works over the next year. We have just completed our first investment round. Currently our CTO does all development, so you’d be our first developer hire. That means we can be flexible about the work you take on, playing to your strengths and your preferences. That also means you can expect to help guide our development and share in our success.<p>Contact george(at)PSYT.co.uk</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7970877" href="vote?for=7970877_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6e%45%30%4d%4f%62%4d%43%45%4a%58%34%59%50%4d%52%6c%5a%77%75%6c%71"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7970877"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=JoeCortopassi">JoeCortopassi</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7970877">link</a></span></div><br>

  * A real voice. We want to know what you think. If you have an idea or think something isn_#x27;t working, we want to hear about it. Your voice counts.
  * Generous options and an actually competitive salary ( no low balling + options bait and switch here ).

  # Who are we?
  #############################
</code></pre>
We_#x27;re Silicon Milkroundabout, the jobs fair for software developers, product managers, designers and marketers interested in working for UK tech startups. We put people directly in touch with the founders and teams behind 150 startups. This works: face-to-face conversations happen, and more than 1,000 people have found new jobs through us since our first event in 2011.<p><pre><code>  #############################
  # Who we’re looking for
  #############################
</code></pre>
We’re looking for an engineer with experience of the usual tech stack ­ AWS, Heroku, Github, Postgres, Rails and JavaScript ­to manage and develop our suite of products. You’ll be strong with development and devops, confident adding features to Rails apps, managing processes such as cron jobs, queuing and database migrations. You’ll move us to continuous integration, test driven development and automated server configuration, ensuring everything keeps working as we migrate. You’ll have a solid disaster recovery plan, but you’ll do what it takes to ensure we don’t need to use it.<p>You’re might not call yourself a front­end or full­stack developer, but you’re comfortable updating existing views and adding whole new user flows to an app. You’re happy to roll your sleeves up and use jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap to get the job done. You know enough CSS to make it look tidy, but you’re not trying to win design awards for your work - you’re happy when everything’s working.<p><pre><code>  #############################
  # Why we’re hiring
  #############################
</code></pre>
We’ve worked with four freelancers in two years, have done a few too many rewrites and maybe didn’t think carefully enough about our build versus buy decisions. We’re looking to put that right. We need someone who can join us for the long term, a safe pair of hands to fix up our systems and fill in the gaps, then take our technology platform to the next level as our company grows. You’ll start working on the SMR product suite, including a B2C web app, a sales CRM, candidate vetting tools and an event check­in app. We also have a public API, event tools, B2B site, data visualisations and a range of microsites in the pipeline. We hope you’ll help shape our roadmap, and as we’re a small team, you’ll join in conversations on everything from our marketing, expansion plans and event experience.<p><pre><code>  #############################
  # Must have
  #############################
</code></pre>
- Experience with AWS, Heroku, Github, Postgres, Rails and JavaScript
- Experience building and maintaining reliable, performant, secure web apps
- Committed to writing elegant, maintainable code with great test coverage
- Reasonable front­end development skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap - enough to get the job done<p><pre><code>  #############################

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Getable — San Francisco, CA<p>Getable is a small team (~10 people) working on changing the construction industry by helping contractors order and manage their rental equipment. We focus on producing high quality apps for three separate users: Contractors, Suppliers, and Getable itself.
We develop our applications using a modular approach on both the frontend and backend, using a modern, mostly open source JavaScript based stack: CouchDB, Node, Engine.io, Backbone, and responsive design.<p>Our frontend is based heavily on Atomic Design and Development, using an open source library we built called Atomify. We optimize for developer happiness and eliminate as many barriers to getting things on production as we can: we don_#x27;t have any build steps, we have a live reloading component development workflow, and we have tests that run as you write your code.<p>Most of our apps are very frontend heavy, but our backend is all realtime. We share model code between the server and the client to make interacting with our data easy.
At the end of the day though, none of that is what makes us get out of bed in the morning. It all comes down to creating great feeling interactions to help our users get their jobs done.<p>Day to Day:<p>- Participate in the team_#x27;s direction and come up with new ideas<p>- Build modules for both the frontend and backend. We embrace open source and modularized development<p>- Participate in and contribute to product discussions<p>Requirements:<p>- Have a passion for building easy to use apps for underserved users<p>- Love to write small, well tested components that can be reused in many contexts<p>- Have experience working on large JS codebases with a team of other highly skilled  engineers<p>- Be able to work on both the frontend and the backend - it_#x27;s all JS<p>We provide:<p>- Meaningful equity<p>- Better than average health plans<p>- Backed by industry leading VCs<p>- Opportunities to grow as a leader or individual contributor<p>- Fun and smart coworkers<p>Sound like a good deal to you?

(We mainly use Python, but don_#x27;t worry if you know something else better.)<p>* Designing semantically meaningful, self-documenting, intuitive APIs, especially for server-to-mobile interaction.<p>* Integrating with sloppy, poorly-documented, sometimes buggy APIs from vendors - and hiding the mess behind a clean interface to ease everyone else_#x27;s job.<p>* Building and extending a database schema that_#x27;s meaningful, readable, and fast.<p>* Developing financial applications of any kind (but payment processing and PCI compliance win bonus points).<p>Front-end developer<p>* Designing and building amazing mobile and responsive-web experiences using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Extra points for native app experience, especially with PhoneGap.<p>* Consuming APIs on a mobile device - and contributing to their design and improvement.<p>* Automating tests for mobile applications.<p>* Using the top tools for elegant, beautiful front-end design and coding - we_#x27;re currently fans of SVGs, web fonts, and Photoshop.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7973474" href="vote?for=7973474_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6e%45%30%4d%4f%62%4d%43%45%4a%58%34%59%50%4d%52%6c%5a%77%75%6c%71"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7973474"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=marmarlade">marmarlade</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7973474">link</a></span></div><br>

Don’t let our name fool you, while our system is fun, our unique, patent-pending, technology is also deeply rooted in scientific modern testing theory.<p>Smarterer is enabling a revolution: in how the enterprise manages their teams and talent, in the changing job marketplace, and in the way people measure their own skills and share that knowledge.<p>We_#x27;re funded by Google Ventures, True Ventures, Re-think education, Boston Seed as well as some amazing angel investors.<p>Interested?

_____________________________________
We_#x27;re looking for someone who writes well, exercises good judgement, is extremely effective, and is energized by being around other people.
Hours:
The job will initially be 20 hours per week on a freelance basis. Assuming you can meet your targets equally well, then you can work from home most days, meaning you_#x27;ll save that unpaid daily waste that exists in other jobs: commuting.<p>What we offer:
_____________________________________
•	Meaningful work, with a huge effect on people_#x27;s lives. You will help people make a career change into arguably the fastest growing profession today.
•	Market rate pay
•	A friendly and intellectual atmosphere, and a tight-knit and supportive team.
•	A warm and welcoming office (near lots of good food and transit).
•	You can sit on our classes when you are not busy; that is, you can start your path to become a data scientist yourself if you are interested
•	Lots of interaction with famous data scientists who come to teach or give talks.
•	Potential for growth. If you get things done, you will be a permanent hire. If you understand the business side of DSR, and help achieving objectives, you will be a crucial part of it
What makes you a strong candidate in our eyes?
We don’t expect any single candidate to have all of these but please mention relevant experience when applying.
•	Good spoken German (native or close).
•	You live in Berlin
•	Attention to detail. You will deal with bills, receipts, etc. Familiarity with doing taxes a plus
•	Some understanding of Facebook and Twitter (Likes, RTs, @, #, DMs, …).
•	Confident writing skills are essential. You will communicate with companies
•	An interesting personality. Let_#x27;s be realistic: a large component of sales is charm.
•	Experience selling over email.
•	Comfortable and confident talking with people you haven_#x27;t met “In Real Life” (one secret: just babble about something random and interesting to break the e-ice).
•	Native or native-level English spelling and grammar.<p>What would be a plus:
_____________________________________
•	Tech-savvy and deep passion for data
•	Prior experience in sales
•	Prior experience assisting an executive<p>What your day-to-day will look like:
_____________________________________
•	Organizing accommodation for visitors

•	Contacting companies that are hiring data scientists, informing them of our program
•	Following up with companies that responded, arranging a call

Running a system on such a large scale is one of the coolest things I_#x27;ve done in my career so far and there is something new and interesting happening every day.<p>Something that is appealing (at least to me), is that the team is running a very _quot;professional_quot; process.  
All of the commits are code reviewed and have passing tests, the colleagues are all great and impressively capable engineers. Everybody is excited about adding things like code metrics, good refactorings and helpful tooling (travis ci, ...). Even though it_#x27;s a somewhat _quot;streamlined_quot; process, there is still enough time to fix those annoying little things (Upgrading the Ruby version we use, restructure our puppet manifests for logical consistency, ...).<p>It_#x27;s a great place to learn and work in a team that actually lives the whole DevOps idea.<p>Andrew (syrneus) is an Engineer and understands the problems that business requirements can have with the current way we_#x27;re doing things.<p>Ok, enough now before the marketing department tries to get me to write a blog post ;)</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7972600" href="vote?for=7972600_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%36%41%38%69%36%73%54%47%69%77%4f%39%48%72%30%59%66%41%79%46%68%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7972600"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=blo">blo</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7972600">link</a></span></div><br>

Yet technology has barely touched the market. Americans buy cars in the same, burdensome ways they did decades ago. Selling a car means either letting the dealer collect a huge margin in a trade-in, or significant hassle selling to a private party. Our goal is to create a delightful experience for every person buying and selling a car, similar to Tesla’s customer service.<p>Shift is extremely well-funded (with a seed round as large as many A rounds), has strong partnerships with key strategic players across the value chain of the car buying process, and has done dozens of sales in San Francisco.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Ruby Developer  | Charlie (an early-stage, funded startup) | Chicago, IL<p>We_#x27;re looking for a developer who_#x27;s sort of a bad-ass. Can you think up mind-blowing solutions to complex, hairy problems? Do you get excited by things like graph databases and machine learning? We want someone who can move fast, think creatively, and deliver quality_#x2F;tested code. Is this you?  Have at least a couple years of professional experience writing code.  Take a small risk and join us in building a growth business.<p>Who are we?
Before any meeting, Charlie automatically researches people before you see them.  Researching people is a complex problem: we sift through, analyze, and manipulate data into powerful insights (i.e. what are they passionate about, what do you have in common?).  CNBC called us “One of the world’s most promising new companies” and SXSW selected us as an Accelerator Finalist.<p>We’ve built Charlie to research people at massive scale, using the latest Ruby on Rails stack with MongoDB, Redis, Sidekiq, and hosted in an elastic cloud farm.  We write code with agility and have a tight process where anyone on the team can deploy to production at any time, without approval.  We thoroughly test our code, though we’re not strict TDD.  We_#x27;re a small dev that loves to code, and constantly pushes, and learns from each other.<p>This is your opportunity to join an early-stage company that’s making moves.<p>Interested?

Our community of around 200,000 data scientists compete to solve complex data problems.  We’re changing the way the most important data-driven problems are solved.  
We have branched out beyond our core business of machine learning competitions, to build end-to-end solutions in specific industries. Our first focus industry is energy, where we are working with Global 10 companies to make better decisions on where and how to drill for oil _amp; gas. Our solutions take detailed geological and engineering data and help predict well performance. These solutions can minimize capital and environmental destruction by helping operators drill fewer uneconomic wells.
Kaggle is located in the heart of the SOMA. We are well-funded (Khosla Ventures, Index Ventures and Max Levchin). Our team includes coffee, beer wine and whisky connoisseurs, pastry chefs, ping pong players, kiteboarders and rollerbladers.<p>---------- Who We_#x27;re Looking For -----------<p>-----Product Manager-----<p>We’re looking for a Product Manager with an interest in hard science and data science. Somebody who can learn a complex and technical industry and empathize with customers who are not always data science savvy. 
What you will be doing<p>* Create and refine the company’s product strategy
	* Work with our customers to understand their economics, buying process and decision making process
	* Develop an understanding of how Kaggle_#x27;s products impact our customer_#x27;s economics and decision making process
	* Collaborate with sales to develop pricing models and identify target customers
	* Collaborate with engineering to prioritizing requirements, scoping feature _amp; set expectations

Our first industry is energy, where we_#x27;re building solutions that can transform the world_#x27;s largest industry.
In the energy sector, we_#x27;ve started with two basic solutions:<p>* using detailed geological data to pick the best place to lease and drill for oil _amp; gas; 
	* using detailed data on drilling practices to help operators produce efficiently.<p>The machine learning and statistical challenges in energy have some interesting properties:<p>* geospatial data
	* mix of deep science and machine learning
	* sample sizes are small and samples are highly correlated
	* we care about explainability and insights<p>Addressing these challenges requires layers upon layers of statistical machine learning models

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Kivo (YC S13) - London<p>We_#x27;re building Github for documents and have started by creating the best way to store, share and get feedback on presentations. We_#x27;re a team of three based in Soho, London. You_#x27;ll be technical hire #2 and have a huge amount of responsibility and ownership of the product. We_#x27;re looking for an excellent front-end developer. You love Javascript, but are comfortable picking up other languages, and obsess over building the best possible user experience. Customer feedback is our guiding light so working closely with users in shaping Kivo should excite you.<p>Our back end is Scala _#x2F; Play and we_#x27;re in the process of moving to Angular, so bonus points for experience with that.<p>Equity grants will be well above market for first hires and salary will be competitive. We want new partners, not just employees, so we are looking for people who are as driven to succeed as we are.<p>We_#x27;re hiring for people who want to help lead the team as we continue to grow, so you should be excited to shape the development culture of a fast growing start-up.<p>We also know there_#x27;s more to life than work. You get gym membership for gyms across London and an extremely sociable team to work with. We love poker, eating out, tennis, and nights at the pub.<p>If this sounds exciting, ping us (leo@kivo.com) and we_#x27;d love to buy you lunch and have a chat.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7970673" href="vote?for=7970673_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%36%41%38%69%36%73%54%47%69%77%4f%39%48%72%30%59%66%41%79%46%68%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7970673"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=hadilaasi">hadilaasi</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7970673">link</a></span></div><br>

San Francisco, CA.<p>Software Engineers: Full-stack, Mobile, DevOps<p>Yesterday we were featured in SFGate with pictures of the apartment we were working out of but, as of today, we have a beautiful new office on 9th Street, South of Mission.<p>A vibrant community of artists and musicians are already using the site and it continues to grow. We just closed our Series A round. We_#x27;re in that moment of transition where the site has stopped being a project written by two enthusiastic roommates and becomes a real company. This means that there_#x27;s a huge amount of work to do on every level of the stack. The existing site is written in PHP, but we_#x27;ve already started adding Node.js services to do the heavy-lifting for new features.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Edge, Inc. - Boston, MA - REMOTE possible
edge.recruiting.boston@gmail.com<p>About Us:
We’re a small company founded by MIT grads that is taking a data-driven approach to online retail. We buy and sell goods in online marketplaces at a large scale based on mathematical models and our solutions to a set of optimization problems. We employ more than 50 workers around the world, but the core team has only a few engineers who have automated most of our process. Our infrastructure is built completely in Python and runs on AWS.<p>Our core team is very small, so our culture is laid back and fun, but we’re all driven and work very hard. We’d like to find a candidate who can thrive in such an environment.<p>About the Job:
We’re looking for a full-stack Python developer to create the next generation of our infrastructure. It’s running on a single AWS server, but we’d like to move to a more scalable distributed model. The infrastructure mostly consists of a backend framework that generates very large datasets, organizes _amp; processes the data, and makes decisions in realtime. There is also a front end written with Flask that will need to be redesigned eventually.<p>The new infrastructure will need to rely on test automation throughout the code, so we’re looking for someone who really understands best practices when it comes to testing. We can handle controlled downtime, but data integrity and the decisions our algorithms make are critical to our business, so we need to build up several layers of testing to ensure correctness.<p>Responsibilities will include:
- Rewriting our Python-based backend and frontend so it’s more maintainable and scalable
- Deploying the new infrastructure on AWS
- Helping us migrate from the existing codebase to the new one
- Modifying the new codebase as we move forward and develop our mathematical models and algorithms<p>Required Qualifications:
- Strong Python development experience
- A solid grasp of test automation, and more importantly some real enthusiasm for it
- Experience designing and deploying on cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services
- Familiarity with both SQL and NoSQL databases, especially relating to their performance
- BS Computer Science or equivalent<p>Preferred Qualifications:
- Experience working both single-handedly and in small groups (2-4 developers)
- Experience with popular Python frameworks and the ability to learn new Python frameworks quickly<p>Email edge.recruiting.boston@gmail.com to learn more.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7971879" href="vote?for=7971879_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%36%41%38%69%36%73%54%47%69%77%4f%39%48%72%30%59%66%41%79%46%68%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7971879"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jonbischke">jonbischke</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7971879">link</a></span></div><br>

We mostly work in Java, but you’ll get bonus points for server_#x2F;backend, MongoDB, HTML, JavaScript, or machine learning experience. You’ll get to design and develop large scale data processing systems, work alongside a talented set of peers, and make an impact beyond what is possible at a large, bureaucratic company.<p>We offer a highly competitive salary and stock compensation package, including 100% employee coverage for medical, dental, life, and disability insurance. We also provide lunch and a fully-stocked snack bar _amp; coffee station.

2 roles in Marketing
INTERN - Outreach (or junior full-time) and Director of Marketing
Both are our first hires to separate the sales role from the marketing_#x2F;lead generation role.<p>These roles are:
 - NOT Cold-Calling.
 - NOT content marketing or advertising.
 - NOT sales (though if you are in sales with experience handling 5 and 6-figure contracts, preferably with SaaS software, please do get in touch).<p>These roles are about identifying leads, nurturing the relationship, and handing off qualified leads to sales. It_#x27;s about GROWTH.<p>We set targets, track progress, and work hard to achieve our goals.<p>Maybe you_#x27;ve built lead pipelines at a prior startup. Maybe you_#x27;ve read Predictable Revenue, SaaStr, or anything else by Jason Lemkin or Aaron Ross. Maybe you_#x27;re looking to launch your own startup, but you want to learn what it takes to get users and customers to your door.<p>Customers include companies like Stripe, Sequoia Capital, and SurveyMonkey. If you like the idea of taking on industry giants who are _quot;too big to succeed_quot; then you should definitely get in touch.<p>We_#x27;re a YC company (S2013) building a software platform for the General Counsel (or VP of Legal, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Compliance Officer) at mid to large companies. We_#x27;re a small team with experienced leadership. We have paying customers today (product is well beyond _quot;MVP_quot;). We are roughly break-even and continue to sell to new customers to reach profitability.

Do you enjoy creating beautiful iOS apps?  Do you have an Apple logo tattooed on your body (completely optional, but that would be very impressive)?<p>Qualifications and Experience:<p>At least 2 years of Objective C hands-on programming
In-depth XCode_#x2F;iOS experience
Fan of agile process and test driven development
Compassion for the end user and an eye for design
Server Side MVC OO programming experience (Django, Rails, Struts, asp.net, Cake)
Believer of Modular Design principles
Hungry to make an impact and take ownership
5+ years of experience
Shake is a venture-backed legal tech startup based in New York.  Our mission is to make the law accessible, understandable and affordable for consumers and small businesses.  We’re starting with simple agreements and building for mobile first.  The company was founded in 2012 by an experienced team of entrepreneurs and investors with executive leadership experience at companies such as Google, Spotify, AOL, Buzzfeed, and RRE Ventures.<p>Shake Principles and Beliefs:<p>We are not afraid to be bold, push the envelope, and challenge the status quo
We are driven by what legal transactions can and will be, not what they have been historically
We value innovative design and superior mobile user experiences
We are a technology company solving a legal problem, not a legal company trying to understand technology
We believe that the legal market is highly underserved by technology and begging for disruption
We believe that significant change in the legal industry will be driven by consumers and small businesses, not by lawyers and law firms
We believe that the value in mobile technology is in building utility not serving banner ads
If you share our beliefs and are passionate about transforming an outdated $250B industry, we look forward to hearing from you.  Feel free to be creative in your application; we like to be surprised!<p>For more information, visit www.ShakeLaw.com.</font></span><p><font size="1"><u><a href="reply?id=8012203_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%52%34%70%75%39%65%43%39%63%78%72%38%48%39%4b%76%48%75%6c%53%6e%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7971244" href="vote?for=7971244_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%52%34%70%75%39%65%43%39%63%78%72%38%48%39%4b%76%48%75%6c%53%6e%39"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7971244"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=svec">svec</a> 21 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7971244">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;ve been around since 2005 as myYearbook, rebranding in 2012 as MeetMe. We_#x27;ve launched other apps such as Choosy, Charm, and Unsaid in the past few months, and are looking to continue adding more standalone apps in the future.<p>We use a wide variety of languages, generally using what makes sense. C, PHP, Python, JavaScript and Node.js, and native iOS and Android development are the most common.<p>MeetMe is a fun place to work. We hold a yearly developer retreat, as well as regular company-wide hackathons. We have a book club, board game club, and we even have a game room. While we aren_#x27;t a new company in the time scale of the internet, we still know how to have fun. We just get the benefit of not having to kill ourselves working 12 hour days. =) This means you_#x27;ll enjoy actually going home on time! We have many openings, both technical and non-technical. Here is a list of positions we are usually always looking for.<p>* Senior Web Developer<p>* Senior Android Developer<p>* Software iOS Developer<p>* Network Engineer<p>You can apply directly here: <a href="http://jobvite.com/m?3Je6egw2" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;jobvite.com_#x2F;m?3Je6egw2</a><p>Or you can contact me at jlotito@meetme.com.
