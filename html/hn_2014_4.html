Different firms, different challenges. Here, a chance to grapple with large-scale payments; there, a purpose-built _quot;big data_quot; storage system; elsewhere, software running on an exotic platform; look hard enough and you may even find custom hardware to tinker with.<p>Consider a greater challenge: the one lurking in the shadows beneath all the other challenges; a maddening, beautiful challenge that awaits all applications, be they YC startups or giant tech companies, the hunt for which leads through the crevices of the payment processing gateways, the arcane backend of the storage system, and the insane, non-euclidian instruction patterns output by embedded compilers. The discovery of the unknown horrible secrets of our universe, the bending of those secrets to your will, and the billing of clients for PDF documentation of those secrets along with their exploitation steps and mitigation advice.<p>Matasano and iSEC together comprise one of the largest pure software security firms in the world. Our clients are the best companies --- and <i>most</i> of the largest of them. Our teams include some of the best researchers in the field.<p>I hire for both firms, our practices interlocked in an unholy embrace.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Khaaaaan! Academy — Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)<p>We_#x27;re a small, non-profit tech startup trying to give a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere.<p>Here_#x27;s a testimonial we received this week:<p>==================================<p>Two year ago, I would never have imagined that any 13-year-old could be in Calculus BC. Today, I am 13 and wrapping up my second semester of it, and with an A+, too, thanks largely in part to this site. Sal, I would say you are the best teacher I ever had. Teachers in school just don_#x27;t seem to have the time or, in some cases, even the knowledge to pay as much attention as you do to the actual intuition of the material being taught. How am I supposed to understand a theorem if I don_#x27;t know where it came from, why it works, or even what it really means? Khan Academy also seems to explain everything in a very easy to understand, and even fun, manor. You make calculus almost as easy as simple arithmetic. Anyway, thank you very much.<p>==================================<p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who_#x27;re thankful for our free, high-quality educational content.<p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal_#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>And now we_#x27;re doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets. We_#x27;re totally overhauling our iOS app and we now need a great mobile designer. (We_#x27;ve got some good leads for good devs already, but if you_#x27;re a dev please do apply too.)<p>We need a great mobile designer, one who lives and breathes mobile and really understands what works and what doesn_#x27;t. If you join us now, you can be a major influence on an app that is guaranteed to have millions of users. We have loads of high-quality educational content just waiting to be shared within a great product. We have partnerships lined up around the block to promote your work. We just need you.<p>You_#x27;ll be part of a small team working alongside both _quot;celebrity_quot; devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google_#x27;s first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven_#x27;t heard of but who are also really awesome.<p>Apply at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/careers" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.khanacademy.org_#x2F;careers</a> and be sure to mention that you_#x27;re coming from HN. Feel free to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org if you have questions about applying or about KA in general.

You must be comfortable participating in design and code reviews, as well as delivering accurate estimates, providing regular development progress feedback and consistently meeting project deadlines. Our developers are effective at explaining complex ideas and concepts to non-technical team members.<p>This is a full time position that would work out of our downtown Detroit office. Occasional telecommuting (like one day a week) is on the table, but we really need people who can be in the office most of the time.<p>Here_#x27;s our stats:<p><pre><code>    Company size: 19

    Current dev team size: 5 (and hiring as fast as we can find good people)

    Stack: LAMP

    Version Control: Git

    Bug Tracking: Github Issues

    Project Management: Basecamp

    Mac or PC: Dealer_#x27;s choice. We currently have 2 devs on mac and 1 on PC.

    Office style: Open floor plan, collaborative working environment, very casual.

    Dev methodologies: We borrow elements of various frameworks, but in general we work in monthly sprint cycles, daily stand-ups, weekly overview meetings.

    Hours: The dev team likes to have people here by 10am most days.
</code></pre>
A word about Detroit: The city gets a lot of bad press. It might not look like an attractive option to people who are considering offers from NY or CA, but I would really encourage people to at least take a look. We_#x27;re in a building with about 20 other tech start-ups who have all received funding.  There is serious investment happening in the city right now. Two months ago I looked up and Warren Buffet (completely unannounced) was 10 feet away from my desk (he_#x27;s partnering on several projects in the city). We sit right across from the Detroit Twitter office. We_#x27;re on the same block as the Detroit Google office. Comerica Park, where the Detroit Tigers play, is 100 yards from our office. Ford Field, where the Lions play, is another about 300 yards away. The part of the city we_#x27;re in is clean and safe with newly built downtown living alternatives. All I_#x27;m saying is: give it a look.<p>If you_#x27;re interested in finding out more, shoot me an email at evan@chalkfly.com.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7510661 href="vote?for=7510661_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%35%30%37%37%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7510661></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dataminded">dataminded</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7510661">link</a></span></div><br>

   ====== What we do =========
   ===========================
</code></pre>
We_#x27;re a logistics visibility platform (read: Waze for Cargo). Weft tracks shipping containers using low-cost hardware to make sure that shipments get to where they_#x27;re supposed to be on time and intact, saving billions in lost value due to cargo shrink and disrupted supply chains. We take the info we get from the hardware and figure out where the bottlenecks in the supply chain are, predict whether or not a shipment is going to make it to its destination on time, and dynamically reroute_#x2F;reschedule shipments so that we can optimize the system as a whole. Really neat stuff. We_#x27;re working on a lot of the things that happen once you have that data, but I can_#x27;t share much about it here<p><pre><code>   ===========================
   ===== How we do it ========
   ===========================
</code></pre>
Web stack -_gt; clojure (immutant) + postgres_#x2F;cassandra_#x2F;riak -- we use middleman + enlive (and a bit of hiccup) for templating, meaning that we_#x27;re pretty flexible about frontend tech.<p>Algorithms -_gt; a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)<p>Hardware -_gt; think cell phone on crack (atmel avr xmega, a bunch of sensors, gps, gsm, etc). Working integrated chip in the sub-$5 price point now! Have some pilots running with v1 hw.<p><pre><code>   ===========================
   ====== And the rest =======
   ===========================
</code></pre>
We_#x27;ve got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies). We also have some top tier investors!<p>Looking for help on mobile, frontend, and data science sides!<p>I should also probably mention that we have a team with a bunch of industry vets!<p>If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at marc@weft.io!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7508229 href="vote?for=7508229_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%35%30%37%37%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7508229></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=gdilla">gdilla</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7508229">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Cargo shrink is a 25B_#x2F;year problem in the US -- way bigger globally (logistics by itself is a 4T industry) -- however, we_#x27;re more about fixing disruptable supply chains (which is way harder to measure, but also way larger).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michigan<p><a href="http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com_#x2F;</a><p>---------------------------------------<p>We are a small team passionate about making people_#x27;s lives better through software. We_#x27;re currently looking for full-time software developers and designers.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don_#x27;t artificially limit ourselves.
    Recently, I_#x27;ve worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap),
    Angular.js, QT and of course Ruby.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and _gt; 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We_#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health_#x2F;vision_#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http:_#x2F;_#x2F;grmakers.com), which gives us
    access to lots of cool tools and machines.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
    Just look here: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;beeradvocate.com_#x2F;beerfly_#x2F;city_#x2F;43

  - If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

We have traction and revenue and funding and great customers. Our customers love us, because we move quickly, build great things, and provide amazing support. Everyone talks to customers a lot.<p>We_#x27;re still a small team, so you_#x27;ll have a large impact on company culture. We_#x27;re highly influenced by Valve_#x27;s Employee handbook, and have as flat a structure as we can. We_#x27;re looking for frontend engineers (JS), designers (must be able to HTML+CSS), and backend engineers (Clojure). Being a mix of those is of course welcome! We lean towards senior experienced engineers, or junior engineers who can display great talent.<p>We_#x27;re also looking for engineers for Developer Success and Developer Awareness positions. Since we have an incredibly technical product, and selling directly to developers, the dev-awareness positions (think marketing, but much more dev-oriented: dev evangelism, writing interesting blogs, CRO, analytics, etc - think a patio11-style engineer) require significant development experience. Dev-success positions are a good fit for engineers who like working with people and building relationships with customers.<p>Check out our jobs page at <a href="https://circleci.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;circleci.com_#x2F;jobs</a>.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7526680 href="vote?for=7526680_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%35%30%37%37%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7526680></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=alabut">alabut</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7526680">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;re a financial media company, a poor man_#x27;s - lest we say everyday man_#x27;s - Bloomberg competitor, and a financial product SaaS all forged together into a powerful trident that is attacking the high seas of Wall Street in a relentless pursuit of transparency.<p>And conquer we shall! We_#x27;ve grown 100% quarter over quarter all last year and another 100% just in the last month. Our team has surged to 30+ people and the waves of revenue washed together to form a rushing roar with just one of our products going from nothing to $200k_#x2F;month in under a year.<p>Being a media company we find our way into all kinds of cool stuff. Our office is furnished with things like a $3000 high-end bed that was sent to us to review. We got to talk to and get pictures with Warren Buffett and Lloyd Blankfein (CEO of Goldman Sachs) when they came to Detroit.<p>But, you interject, finance is one of the toughest startup seas to sail upon! The old boys club runs an ironclad ship with no visible decks for boarding. Avast! We_#x27;ve built a battering ram of a business in just a few short years that has pummeled its way deep into the heart of Wall Street. Old Ironsides has warmed itself to Benzinga and once a taste the thirst cannot be quenched.<p>We_#x27;ve recently became Microsoft_#x27;s premier finance partner alongside 3 other companies, all worth over a billion dollars and established for years. As of this Christmas we were installed by default on 500 million desktops and tablets via Windows 8 Finance. No download necessary. That_#x27;s right mateys, we_#x27;re in the source code.<p>And if you happen to trade or invest yourself you_#x27;ll find us inside almost all of the major brokerages in the US.<p>So, where do you fit in this rigging, you swashbuckling scalawag? Well, our team is crazy ambitious, motivated, and experienced with shaking shit up. If you know your tech, and want on deck this is the place to do it. Your exact technical background and language of choice doesn_#x27;t matter as much as your motivation and your ability to adapt quickly. We are a young team and we_#x27;re especially looking for sailors who_#x27;ve got some salt in their whiskers who can help us scale from millions to hundreds of millions.<p>Why be a ninja when you can be a pirate?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Engine Yard - Fulltime, REMOTE<p>Frontend Engineer<p>We_#x27;re one of the oldest PaaS_#x27;s out there, with support for PHP_#x2F;Ruby_#x2F;Java_#x2F;node.js and both AWS and Azure. Earlier this year we launched a brand new user experience from the ground-up -- a new website and a completely new client-side interface. As a Frontend Engineer, you_#x27;d be working primarily on the latter.<p>The UI is written using angular.js served up by a lightweight node.js api proxy server. We use mocha_#x2F;selenium web driver for our tests and only accept green builds via travis to be merged to master. Through our _quot;eybot_quot; on slackhq, we deploy stable code to production multiple times a day.<p>The UX engineering team at Engine Yard consists of 3 UI designers and 4 engineers (including myself). We_#x27;re spread out across 8 timezones (Dublin through San Francisco), so experience working in a distributed team is key.<p>You_#x27;ll get:<p><pre><code>    * Competitive salary
    * Full medical, dental and vision benefits
    * 25 paid days off per year
    * 401(k)
    * We take care of your phone bill
    * Paid travel to conferences
</code></pre>
Must haves:<p><pre><code>    * A passion for writing great software to solve real problems for real people
    * Demonstrated experience building complex client-side applications in
      JavaScript, preferably with angular.js
    * Experience working in a distributed team
    * The strong belief that a feature isn_#x27;t finished until it_#x27;s tested and, where
      appropriate, documented
    * A fantastic sense of sarcasm
    * Ability to travel occasionally (at least once or twice a year)
    * Somewhere between UTC and UTC-8
</code></pre>
Great to have:<p><pre><code>    * Thorough understanding of git
    * Experience building REST apis
    * Experience with multiple languages (and an understanding of their tradeoffs)
    * Previously worked at a startup
</code></pre>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>TechEmpower - Los Angeles area, California (El Segundo, near LAX)<p>You may recognize us from the Web Framework Benchmarks that have been discussed on HN periodically: <a href="http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.techempower.com_#x2F;benchmarks_#x2F;</a>
(We_#x27;re working on getting Round 9 out as soon as possible--we swear!)<p>Here_#x27;s the job:<p>TechEmpower, a small custom software development firm located in El Segundo, seeks developers with good object-oriented experience, preferably in Java, JavaScript, Python, and_#x2F;or Ruby. We specialize in web application development but look for well-rounded application developers. If you are a solid programmer and a team player, this is an opportunity for you. Even if you don_#x27;t have experience with everything listed in this ad, we offer excellent learning opportunities for those who are eager to expand their skill sets.
Job Responsibilities<p>Working in small development teams, programmers participate in the architecture, design, and implementation of primarily Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and PHP code to meet client requirements for robust, high-performance, and secure sites and applications. Developers get exposure to several client projects and a variety of technologies over time.
Job Qualifications<p>In addition to overall programming capability, candidates must have experience working on collaborative development teams and very strong communication skills. While we employ and enjoy the company of extroverts and introverts alike, we reiterate that the ability to communicate clearly is a must-have for our technical staff. That means writing professional e-mails and interpreting the nuances of clients_#x27; requirements by asking good questions, for example.<p>We work hard to estimate projects accurately so that schedules are reasonable and developers work a normal amount of hours per week. We rely on developers to contribute to those estimates and provide feedback as a project goes along to keep things on track.<p>Ideal candidates will have experience building all facets of software systems including the data model, business logic, and front-end. 3+ years of object-oriented design and development in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby is desired. On the front-end, HTML 5 and CSS experience is required.<p>Knowledge of some or all of the following specific tools and technologies is a plus:<p><pre><code>    Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP
    Tools: Continuous Integration (Jenkins, Hudson, etc.), static code analysis (Sonar, etc.), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven
    Web: vert.x, Play, Spring, Django, Rails, node.js, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.
    Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile or similar
    Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), cloud servers, Linux configuration, application servers (Resin, etc.)
    Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, Oracle, NoSQL (CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.) 
</code></pre>
We like technical people who are not afraid to have strong opinions about technology but simultaneously keep an open mind and are flexible enough to work with whatever technology the task at hand requires.<p>That said, we_#x27;re mostly looking for great developers who are great to work with. If you don_#x27;t have experience with everything listed above (and who does?) but are still a solid developer eager to learn new things, you might be a great fit here.<p>Please apply here: <a href="http://jobs.techempower.com/hn" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;jobs.techempower.com_#x2F;hn</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7509392 href="vote?for=7509392_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%35%30%37%37%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7509392></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sh1mmer">sh1mmer</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7509392">link</a></span></div><br>

Our model for this initiative is the work we’ve done on the Harvard Personal Genome Project (PGP), which has over 3,000 volunteers publicly sharing extensive biological and trait data, including hundreds of whole genomes, exomes, and genotyping data sets, over 1,000 health records, microbiome datasets from various bodily habitats, device data, brain imaging, etc. This combination of a highly informed and engaged community of volunteers and their contributions of extremely rich biological and health data, along with a network of collaboration-minded researchers, is an incredibly powerful scientific and educational resource that is unrivaled elsewhere. We will build on this momentum with this exciting new initiative that will transform participatory research and advance human health.
Our current hiring position is focusing on someone with back-end web development skills, as we have plans to work with a design firm for initial front-end work.

Its efforts are informed by values encouraging greater transparency and collaboration between researchers and participants. The organization supports the Personal Genome Project (PGP) global network. The first PGP research study was founded at Harvard Medical School in 2005, and PGP sites now exist at leading institutions in four countries.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Hey everyone, hope your April is off to a killer start!<p>Like in last month_#x27;s Who is hiring I wanted to share all our numbers for complete transparency. March just came to a close and Buffer stands at 1.4M total users served by a small 21 person team spread across 14 cities and 5 continents. 130,000 of our users are actively using the product each month. We generated $350,000 in March, and we have $580,000 in the bank. The average salary at the company is $98,000 and our total funding to date is $450,000 which we raised in December 2011, for which we gave up 14% of the company. I_#x27;m sharing all of this because one of the highest values we have at Buffer is to be fully transparent, and I_#x27;d love for you to be part of the incredible journey we_#x27;ve embarked upon.<p>At 16% month over month revenue growth on average in the last 6 months, we_#x27;re seeing increasing demand to build out the product further and help our fast-growing customer base with all their social media problems. To achieve this, we_#x27;d love your help with some interesting engineering challenges.
Do any of these areas stand out for you? I_#x27;d really love to hear from you:<p><pre><code>    - Reliability Hacker (we_#x27;re sending 450,000 posts to
      social networks every day, our architecture is still
      not ideal)
    - Android Lead (our Android app has half a million
      downloads but currently no full-time developer!)
    - iOS Hacker (our favorite people who use Buffer are
      all crying out for an iPad app)
    - Growth Hacker (our landing page conversion is at 7%,
      we_#x27;d love your help improving it and many other
      metrics)
    - Frontend Hacker (last month 130,000 people used
      Buffer, we_#x27;d love to improve our dashboard interface
      and extensions for them)
</code></pre>
Some of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS).<p><pre><code>    - We_#x27;re completely open about salary and equity, in
      fact here is a spreadsheet of all individual salaries:

      It_#x27;s most likely you_#x27;d fall into a range of
      $85,000-$150,000 and 0.1%-1%.
    - We_#x27;re a fully distributed remote team, and we come
      together 3 times a year for super fun retreats.
      The last one was in Thailand in December, our next
      is Cape Town in April!
    - We have a big focus on culture, that_#x27;s the main thing

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Well, that goes much further than I would go in defining _quot;half decent_quot;.  To me, that comes off as a real Type A, game the system type approach.  If the market was really as hot as is often claimed, that would not be remotely necessary in order to be noticed.<p>What I think is going on, having observed from outside for many years, is that a certain subset of companies are fighting over the same small subset of engineers (self confident, type A shameless marketeers who happen to already be located in SV, NYC, or Seattle) and complaining that they can_#x27;t find people because this subset is too small to satisfy them all.<p>I have had a LinkedIn profile for almost as long as LinkedIn has been around.  I have had a website with my own domain name since 1999.  I do not have personal or professional experience in $FLAVOR_OF_THE_WEEK.  Despite all the talk here and elsewhere about how its fundamentals that matter and anyone competent can pick up $LANGUAGE or $FRAMEWORK in the time it takes to become familiar with the codebase, everyone still seems to hire based on the buzzwords.<p>No one ever taught me that I should be treating my resume like an SEO problem.  In fact, I have received so much contradictory advice about how to structure my resume over the years that I am almost ready to throw up my hands in disgust.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>First off, I apologize for my tone.  I was tired and cranky last night when I wrote that and should not have posted it.  I did not intend to belittle anyone, though it came out that way.<p>_gt; You_#x27;re not using the technologies that are in demand, you_#x27;re not writing detailed work histories, and you_#x27;re not putting key words into your resume, please tell me you do not wonder why you_#x27;re not being head hunted.<p>I_#x27;m not sure if you are saying this with or without having looked at my information, so I will write the response assuming you have not.<p>I use what my employers require me to use, plus whatever else I can get away with that is appropriate for the task at hand.  I also experiment with new languages in my free time, though I stopped listing those on my resume and LinkedIn profile on the advice that I should only be listing items I was willing to be tested on.  If I find something that is better for a task that needs doing, I use it.  As for my work history, I have a detailed history, but I tried to control the amount of detail in each entry to avoid making it too long.<p>_gt; Everything starts off as a flavor of the week, Ruby on Rails was just a flavor of the week type deal and then it became huge. Same with Node now and with other stacks before that.<p>Absolutely, though most fade away into relative obscurity at some point.  The point I was trying to make there is that I frequently see statements about fundamentals being important and specific technologies not being important because technologies can be learned quickly by a competent developer.  Yet the laundry lists of technology requirements seems to grow monthly.  I_#x27;m going to learn new stacks because they are interesting and potentially useful to me, not to pad my resume.<p>Overall, maybe it was a good thing I shoved my foot in my mouth above.  It drove me to think critically about my overall presentation to the outside world.  I usually approach it with too much emotional attachment.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=360></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7516525 href="vote?for=7516525_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%35%30%37%37%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7516525></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=potatolicious">potatolicious</a> 33 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7516525">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>_gt; <i>_quot;though I stopped listing those on my resume and LinkedIn profile on the advice that I should only be listing items I was willing to be tested on._quot;</i><p>I_#x27;d recommend listing them, especially if you are interested in jobs that use them. If you are suffering from a deluge of recruiters, by all means, do what you need to do to slow down the flow - but it doesn_#x27;t seem like that_#x27;s your problem.<p>Here_#x27;s the thing - the people who are going to be interviewing you and ascertaining your technical capabilities are <i>not</i> the same ones looking for you on the internet (LinkedIn and beyond). Don_#x27;t let a non-technical person say no to you (or worse, never see your profile to begin with).<p>Put the keyword up, there_#x27;s no need to be deceptive about it. _quot;Hi, you look like a good fit at our company because of X_quot; _quot;I_#x27;ve used X in my spare time but never professionally, if that_#x27;s alright with you let_#x27;s continue the conversation_quot; - you_#x27;d be surprised at how many companies are willing to keep talking. The demand is intense.<p>There_#x27;s nothing untoward or dishonest happening here. You_#x27;re listing out the things that you know, you_#x27;re not lying about anything, you_#x27;re being entirely upfront - the only extra consideration is writing in such a way that someone searching for you would see you in a search result. Name-drop languages, frameworks, libraries, as appropriate, because those are the primary levers recruiters know to pull when searching.<p>_gt; <i>_quot;I have a detailed history, but I tried to control the amount of detail in each entry to avoid making it too long._quot;</i><p>I_#x27;d suggest expanding. We_#x27;re <i>way</i> past the days where recruiting happened via a pile of resumes on someone_#x27;s desk, and a long one would make it straight into the rubbish bin without a glance. By the time human eyes hits your profile page it_#x27;s already gone through a search filter and likely other recruitment filters - it_#x27;s okay to be a bit verbose since interest is already there. Especially if this verbosity increases your odds of making it past a search filter.<p>_gt; <i>_quot;I_#x27;m going to learn new stacks because they are interesting and potentially useful to me, not to pad my resume._quot;</i><p>Right, and my suggestion isn_#x27;t to pad your resume with useless filler. That does nobody any good - recruiters end up looking at profiles that have nothing to do with the jobs they_#x27;re looking to fill. The idea is to think about the jobs you want (and are qualified for), think about what <i>their</i> recruiters are searching for, and making sure your profile gets hit when they search for said things.<p>The goal isn_#x27;t to appear in more search results <i>in general</i>, it_#x27;s to appear in more search results relevant to the jobs you_#x27;re looking to find.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=400></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7517849 href="vote?for=7517849_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%35%30%37%37%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7517849></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rezistik">rezistik</a> 33 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7517849">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yea, 3 years can be very little. But 3 years of real experience (plus intelligence) and the ability to actually come up with new and relevant solutions to problems probably trumps 15+ years of doing the same year_#x27;s worth of work over and over again (not that uncommon), 20+ years working on technology that_#x27;s no longer relevant, 10+ years of only doing what you_#x27;re told while not being able to think for yourself, or any other number of things.<p>Filter out cockiness_#x2F;arrogance that gets in the way of productivity_#x2F;progress, etc: yes. Tell someone who_#x27;s simply confident in their abilities that they don_#x27;t know what they are doing because they <i>only</i> have 3 years of experience: no.<p>I understand that the prevalence of the so-called _quot;entitled youth_quot; has everyone ruffled these days, but there_#x27;s a difference between being arrogant and feeling entitled (I_#x27;m sure these people exist, but don_#x27;t they always), and not accepting the old world BS of bowing your head, taking everyone_#x27;s shit, doing what you_#x27;re told, then settling for the scraps that get thrown your way (something you should feel so lucky to have happen). In the case of the latter, that world needs to die, and I_#x27;m all about progress and moving past such suffocating, stagnating, backward nonsense.<p>Also, when it comes to programming, after about 5 years everyone evens out (with regards to gains unique_#x2F;specific to years of experience) and there isn_#x27;t really much difference. Everything past that is mostly inside knowledge or factual knowledge that you get from happening to work at one company or another (or with some person that happens to know said things). And since the technological landscape (past whatever the latest buzzwords or fads are) changes at least every 5 years, all that specific knowledge loses relevance with time.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7512509 href="vote?for=7512509_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%35%30%37%37%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7512509></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dinkumthinkum">dinkumthinkum</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7512509">link</a></span></div><br>

For most family plans that_#x27;s 3 - 4k in expense.<p>That said, it really depends how much they are paying the prospective employee while contracting.

Having a conversation with your manager about your market value should yield a higher salary that is competitive. If not, move along.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Great questions Ryan!<p>Happiness Heroes are the people who help customers with queries via Email, Twitter and Live Chat. Weekend Warriors are people in the team who help with those same things during the weekend (though it_#x27;s a full-time 5 days a week role, so 3 other days too). We have 6 full-time members of this Happiness team, it_#x27;s something we make a very high priority. In the last month we answered 92% of emails within 6 hours, 65% within 1 hour, with a volume of around 10,000 emails.<p>I can definitely see how it seems Mary is getting screwed. Our equity number there is misleading, she has 0.3% (column to the right). Key things to note: Mary lives in Spokane, which has a relatively low cost of living and falls into our _quot;C_quot; bracket in the salary formula. If she moves, her salary will go up by either $6K or $16K depending on where she moves to. Also, Mary chose equity over salary (yay) which is a choice to increase equity by taking $10K less salary. I hope that helps explain things there, let me know if you have any more questions!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7513257 href="vote?for=7513257_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%35%30%37%37%36%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7513257></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=WWLink">WWLink</a> 33 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7513257">link</a></span></div><br>

At the moment this is how it looks: 1 technical interview with Sunil (discussion on past experience, code walkthrough and a high level technical question).  2 culture interviews with Carolyn and Leo.

[LOCAL | RELOCATE OK]<p>We_#x27;re a YC company with a friendly-beta sales tool (close to going public-beta) that helps small and large companies catch opportunities from slipping through the cracks.<p>If you_#x27;ve ever run a startup, you know how difficult it can be to stay on top of sales. And you also know how many companies fail because of it. We want to make them succeed.<p>We also spend time improving our tooling, and tools for other developers.<p><pre><code>  * We run the SF ClojureScript meetup
  * Incredibly modern stack: written entirely in Clojure_#x2F;ClojureScript_#x2F;Om_#x2F;React
  * Released the first reference Om app (https:_#x2F;_#x2F;github.com_#x2F;sgrove_#x2F;omchaya)
  * Given presentations on how we see app development trending http:_#x2F;_#x2F;sgrove.github.io_#x2F;omchaya_#x2F;docs_#x2F;presentation.html (hint: It_#x27;s about to get much, much better, and referentially-transparent UI_#x27;s and serializable state play a big part)
  * We_#x27;ve vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler
  * Reified keywords to the runtime to make ClojureScript a better citizen on the web
</code></pre>
We do all of this for two reasons: 1.) We want to build apps that customers love in the best way possible, and that often means taking the time to explore proper approaches. With the right team and stack, we run circles around others, and 2.) because we want to give back to the communities that have enabled us.
We_#x27;re looking for an engineer who loves the craft, who cares about building product, and is excited about helping customers.<p>Interested in working with Reactjs, Om, and functional programming in the client? We_#x27;re building a team that_#x27;s able to reduce complexity others balk at into simple, easy to reason about system, so we can continue to move quickly and delight both customers and ourselves.
This is fullstack work.<p>Languages: Clojure, Clojurescript, Javascript. sean @ zenboxapp <a href="https://www.zenboxapp.com" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.zenboxapp.com</a>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The choice between a masters and working in Clojure is a fantastic one to have! I certainly wouldn_#x27;t use the word _#x27;alas_#x27;.<p>We_#x27;ve given talks on some stuff we believe is cutting-edge in UI work not just for the browser (though certainly light years ahead for it), but also for the desktop. A lot of the pieces are starting to just fall out from good design decisions made by others.<p>For example, we_#x27;ve talked about being able to effortlessly capture recordings of user-behavior and use them for instant repro-cases (goodbye exceptional stacktraces of _#x27;undefined is undefined_#x27;!) or for prediction-testing (_quot;Did anything we changed with this release we_#x27;re about to push break a replay from the last 10,000 sessions on our site?_quot;), to truly-reusable components and tooling-amenable systems. We need to get around to blogging about it, certainly.<p>Web components are going to be a nice boon for an underlying substrate, but the spec is still in flux, and we_#x27;ll see what actually ends up happening. But the uncontrolled state mutations (and quite a few other things) means that it_#x27;s not the right level for most of us to be working at.<p>Definitely some exciting stuff happening on the front-end right now, we really have the chance to push things forward for thousands of developers.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7509428 href="vote?for=7509428_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%6a%6d%41%61%7a%58%72%69%66%52%74%52%34%39%6c%4c%6e%58%4b%69%4f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7509428></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tristanz">tristanz</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7509428">link</a></span></div><br>

Our app is used by millions of users every month worldwide and needs to be the best in its class, our goal being to grow it to one of the top apps worldwide. Our app aims to stretch the technologies provided by iOS and Android to their limits, and relies heavily on reliable and highly efficient backend services and infrastructure to deliver an amazing experience. For content creators, our web front-end must be solid and quickly adaptable to new user demands.<p>We have three positions currently open:<p>------------------------------------------<p>- Back-End Python Developer<p>You will be joining a team of server developers with varied skills in web development, systems development, devops and QA.<p>Your primary roles will be to champion good software development practices in the team and to deliver high quality Python code. You will contribute to architecture and technical design of our back-end and of the Layar ecosystem as a whole. Our development team is small, and you can - and are encouraged to - have a big impact on product and technical decisions.<p>We expect you to be an experienced coder and technical designer, with a proven track record of designing, building, delivering and maintaining multi-server, scalable systems. A passion for delivering good products is essential. You know not only to make a computer do what you want, but also how to build (and keep building) a complex software product, within a varied and dynamic team.<p>We are specifically looking for:<p>* A proven track record in working on heterogeneous and distributed systems.<p>* 3+ Years of Python development experience.<p>* Experience with distributed source control (e.g. Mercurial, Git).<p>* Flexibility to deal with a rapidly changing environment.<p>Preferably you also have<p>* Experience with Python frameworks such as Django and Twisted.<p>* Experience with Infrastructure-as-a-Service, preferably AWS.<p>* Experience with automating analysis of large data sets.<p>------------------------------------------<p>- Android Developer<p>We are seeking a senior Android Developer who will take charge of our Android app and bring them to the next level.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>London, UK — Fountain Digital Labs (<a href="http://www.fountain-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.fountain-digital.com</a>) — All-round backend developer<p>We_#x27;re a well-funded 1.5 year old startup working on the delivery of live video streams from our own cameras around the globe into an iPad app for children. We_#x27;re currently rolling out our first two installations — in Dubai and in Moscow. And we just grew to ten people.<p>Both the client part (iOS) and the video processing backend (Python_#x2F;ffmpeg) are being actively developed in-house. We_#x27;re currently looking for a Python developer, full-time in London. Our office is at TechHub (207 Old Street), in the heart of the Silicon Roundabout, but we_#x27;ll be moving to the new office in the same area very soon.<p>The usual job description blurb is at our landing page at <a href="http://www.fountain-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.fountain-digital.com</a>. I want to add that it_#x27;s a great opportunity for a backend developer to get involved in a very serious wide-scale project. We_#x27;re not in the business of making websites or Facebook apps, our video cloud routinely loads tens of large Amazon EC2 instances — and grows automatically as you add new video streams. We_#x27;re really doing interesting work here.<p>If you_#x27;ve never done Python in production, but love distributed systems, programming at scale and are a strong all-rounder — feel free to apply anyway. We love working with smart and hardworking people.<p>If you want to ask anything about the product, technology, or anything else, drop me a line (I_#x27;m the CTO). My email is in the profile.<p>No recruiters please.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7507934 href="vote?for=7507934_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%6a%6d%41%61%7a%58%72%69%66%52%74%52%34%39%6c%4c%6e%58%4b%69%4f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7507934></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=benjaminwootton">benjaminwootton</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7507934">link</a></span></div><br>

But, we_#x27;re especially excited about the following engineering profile:<p>THE ROLE:<p><pre><code>  Senior Systems Engineer: You_#x27;ve architected and scaled backend systems to 
  millions of users.  You_#x27;ve put out every kind of fire and learned a lot in the

  architectures, and low-level services.

OUR STACK:<p><pre><code>  - Redis, MySQL, Rails for our backend API.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Search scientist. Amsterdam. Relocation and Visa provided. And I mean <i>real</i> search scientist, not just someone who put together Solr that one time.<p>We have a client who has a fantastic position which has opened up. They’re searching for you because you’ll be searching for them: they need an expert search engine_#x2F;data mining specialist and very few people can fill this role.<p>You’ll have several years of experience with search engines and (preferably) e-commerce, a proven capability to mine data and a Master’s or Doctorate in Statistics, Math, AI, Computer Science or a comparable background. This isn’t for someone who’s just set up Elasticsearch, Solr, or some other search engine (though that helps). It’s for someone who can mine the data of customer searches and provably demonstrate they can create better search results for customers. You won’t be waiting for tasks to do: you’ll be deciding the tasks and how to do them.<p>How do you exclude a location 500 meters away from the one a customer is searching for but it’s across an international boundary or a river with no bridge? How do you do that in a performant manner? Or maybe searches in different languages should be treated differently based on cultural preferences? And do different categories of customers have different search needs? How would they be categorized and how would different search results impact them? Or maybe you can demonstrate that the above wouldn’t impact sales and you have a better solution?<p>The possibilities are endless and the position itself is very high level within the company. They’re offering a generous salary, an awesome work_#x2F;life balance, a generous vacation package and a catch: you have to let them pay to relocate your household (even rats, if you want to) to the heart of Amsterdam, one of the most beautiful cities in the world. If you’re going to be sitting down sketching out how to group customers using adaptive resonance theory, wouldn’t it be lovely to do that while sipping a Grolsh, eating bitterballen, next to a beautiful Dutch canal?<p>And with 26 days of vacation and 9 public holidays, you’ll have seven weeks off a year to enjoy. Take a relaxing two-week road trip across Europe and return to work with several weeks of holiday left.<p>Given the extremely high level of expertise needed for this role, our client realizes that the few people who are both capable and willing to accept this role will need a relocation package. And if you have a family, our client will take care of them, too. Have special relocation requirements? As long as you are willing to work in Amsterdam, bring them up and the company will see what they can do. On top of that, you’ll probably qualify for something called the 30% ruling. This is a law passed by the Dutch government to attract top experts like you. When you qualify, you’ll be taxed on only 70% of your salary. The other 30% will be handed to you tax-free, effectively giving you a huge pay rise on top of an already generous salary.<p>This is a high level position in the company and you’ll be given a lot of autonomy to make things happen. Further, the success criteria for the job are extremely clear and you’ll be given all the tools you need to directly measure your success. The exact nature of the role can potentially be tailored to meet your personal preferences.<p>The work environment is laid-back, English is the working language, and you’ll be working with other expats with a sense of adventure. Amsterdam is a friendly, low-crime city and almost everyone speaks English fluently, but if you want Dutch lessons, our client will help. Heck, if you have other requirements, bring them and get them on the table. For the right candidate, everything’s open to discussion.<p>If this sounds interesting and you want more information, contact us at jobs@allaroundtheworld.fr.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7512124 href="vote?for=7512124_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%6a%6d%41%61%7a%58%72%69%66%52%74%52%34%39%6c%4c%6e%58%4b%69%4f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7512124></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=phantom_oracle">phantom_oracle</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7512124">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Hey, thanks for being so friendly! :) And recruiters have been here for a while.<p>Seriously, though, check my post history. I_#x27;m more than just a recruiter — I_#x27;m a serious dev and I_#x27;m willing to bet I_#x27;ve released more open source code than most people on HN and I can almost guarantee it_#x27;s more widely used. The reality is that many companies know neither how to source candidates nor how to evaluate them. Being well-known in some tech communities (<a href="https://www.google.fr/search?q=curtis+poe+perl" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.google.fr_#x2F;search?q=curtis+poe+perl</a>) means I can evaluate those candidates and I can also source them.<p>Yes, recruiters have a poor reputation and there_#x27;s a reason that many (most?) deserve that, but for companies who can_#x27;t source candidates, they_#x27;re stuck. Recruiters, particularly those who specialize, tend to have large pools of _quot;goto_quot; people that companies would never have, meaning that companies who can_#x27;t find talent have little choice.<p>The reason recruiters are despised so much is that there_#x27;s such a low barrier to entry to our field that this depresses quality tremendously. I don_#x27;t like it either, but we_#x27;re not <i>all</i> the same. Frankly, I wish there was some way to enforce standards for recruiters and find a way for both employees and employers to _quot;out_quot; bad recruiters.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7516942 href="vote?for=7516942_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%6a%6d%41%61%7a%58%72%69%66%52%74%52%34%39%6c%4c%6e%58%4b%69%4f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7516942></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=phantom_oracle">phantom_oracle</a> 33 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7516942">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><p><pre><code>    Senior PHP Engineer
    We Are Base
    Bournemouth, United Kingdom
    Full time, in house 
</code></pre>
A bit about the role <p>This is a genuine opportunity to work alongside talented people to innovate and build digital services that make a difference to people every day, including an exciting product spin out. Working in an increasingly connected life, the role looks a little something like this:<p>1st class engineer <p>You will be used to working as part of an unsilo’d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they’re useful. Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript_#x2F;Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You’ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura _amp; Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress. You’ll be comfortable with object orientated design patterns, unit testing, APIs _amp; databases. Every pony at Base is capable of more than one trick. You’ll have an understanding of usability and how that works with functionality<p>Data hungry <p>You’ll have a keen interest in datasets, with good skills in filtering the signals from the noise. You’ll have an eye to the future and know that tracking something now will make for way more interesting times later. You’ll be comfortable integrating 3rd party systems through APIs you’ve helped architect.<p>Open all hours <p>You’ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you’ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you’ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.<p>Solver of riddles <p>You won’t know the answer to every question that comes your way, but you’ll be someone who knows how to hunt it down. This job isn’t forensic science, but being able to piece the jigsaw back together and crack the nut is your daily bread. Inquisitive by nature you, like us, want to understand what makes things tick to make them better.<p>Getting shit done <p>You’ll understand technical debt and be acutely aware that most pieces of code aren’t perfect, but you’ll be good at balancing the need to do something beautifully and the need to do it fast, including both where you can. You’ll regularly use Git, bash scripting and Sass, or similar, because of what they bring to the table.<p>Commercially aware <p>You will be able to develop a genuine understanding of our client businesses, allowing you to identify opportunities for and with them. The best developers understand the end goal, not just their role in a project. You’ll be able to think commercially about the client business, as well as deliver work that doesn’t fall over as its user base scales. You’ll be expected to apply innovation to solve challenges, remembering that the best solutions are often beautiful in their simplicity.<p>Keen eye, tuned ear <p>An eye for detail and a high standard of output is important to the success of the role. We’ve developed a code standard that gives us a bar to reach for. You’ll play a part in developing and guiding it as we grow. You’ll know that most project budgets don’t allow interface designers to cover every inch of an application, so you’re good at communicating with them and finding ways to smartly join the dots with a minimum of fuss.<p>Security and speed <p>You’ll be hot on security too. The one thing that no one sees, until it goes to the wall. Then everyone knows about it. You’ll know how to react when an overseas friend tries to gain access to one of your servers from your years of ethical hacking. Creating applications that are quick is fundamental to the role too. An understanding of devices, connections and optimisation is key to delivering the quality we’re after. But then you already know that.<p>About We Are Base<p>We_#x27;re a digital service design company that builds user-centred digital services for businesses, using data they already have.<p>We help our clients realise opportunities by transforming their data into something new and valuable. Clients include Timex, Garmin and Nottingham City Transport.<p>At Base you will be part of a team of makers and doers, working across a variety of projects and clients. We’re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.<p>We value and support CPD, actively seeking clients with a like-minded desire to push boundaries, providing you with an opportunity to build your experience and skills.<p>We practice a sustainable pace, recognising that we each have lives and families outside of work. Late nights and _gt; 40 hour weeks are rare by design.<p><a href="http://wearebase.com/hiring" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;wearebase.com_#x2F;hiring</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7507769 href="vote?for=7507769_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%6a%6d%41%61%7a%58%72%69%66%52%74%52%34%39%6c%4c%6e%58%4b%69%4f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7507769></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wdhaines">wdhaines</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7507769">link</a></span></div><br>

We do a fair amount of big data streaming and reporting. Our architecture is unique and our software stack purposefully diverse.  Everyone on the team possesses a strong sense of ownership of their work.  Your contributions will be immediate and will be felt through out the company.<p>I can vouch for the fact that working at Connexity is fun, fast-paced, and open-ended.  No dogma here.

Tugg is head quartered in the beautiful hills of Austin, Texas but has recently expanded to several remote offices. We have big ideas and are looking to expand our already great team!
Tugg is a platform that enables people to choose the films that play in their local theaters as well as to promote their own events. Our experienced team helps guide anyone from a first time promoter to someone hosting their 100th Tugg event on the path to creating a successful screening.<p>As Tugg continues to disrupt the way films are released in theaters, we are also growing the platform to become a major player in entertainment e-commerce. From the sale of Video on Demand, DVDs, and merchandise, to a broad offering of curated products from makers around the world, Tugg is building tools to make it easy for content owners, influencers, brands and fans to collaborate under one roof to know and grow their audience more vigorously than ever before.<p>------------<p>Requirements<p>------------<p>- Coding in Ruby or another scripting language. (Python, Perl, Javascript, etc.)<p>- Database administration using Postgres or MySQL.<p>- Application architecture design and implementation.<p>- User experience driven.<p>------------<p>What we are offering<p>------------<p>- A competitive salary: We offer competitive pay that is commensurate with experience.<p>- Competitive healthcare benefits<p>- Relaxed vacation policy: We are a small company. Nobody will be watching you clock in or out.  We simply expect you to get done what you say you will get done.<p>- Work remotely<i>:  We are based in Austin, Texas. Ideally, you are based here, or willing to relocate (relocation assistance available).  When we don_#x27;t need to be in the office, we tend to work from home, coffee shops, parks, etc. That said, we would strongly prefer candidates who are regularly able to work from either the Austin or LA office.  </i>Unfortunately, we are unable to sponsor H1B applicants.<p>- Happy environment:  We are a fairly young company, working in the entertainment space.  We like to have happy hours, outings, and other play times. We keep a kitchen stocked with snacks and have a budget for quality of life improvements.<p>------------<p>How to apply<p>------------<p>In addition to a resume and a short cover letter, please send us some links to view your code.

Course Hero is looking for a software engineer who can hit the ground running.<p>Our team releases code every day to millions of people, so we_#x27;re looking for someone who can take on challenges, build new features, and iterate quickly.

Our projects are big -- terabytes of data and customers around the world -- but our team is small, so you’ll see projects from start to finish, working closely with product managers and designers to ensure successful results.<p>Our company culture is very open, flat, and transparent. We succeed and learn together. Our office is very comfortable, has a lot of natural light, and great amenities like a gym and walking trails onsite. We’ve tried hard to make this a pleasant and inspiring place to do creative work.<p>Most importantly, we seek to hire individuals whose personality, integrity and passion for our business make our team better as a whole. We’re growing fast, profitable (yes, it’s true!), and looking for another core team member to push us toward the future.<p>Our stack is LAMP (PHP) + jQuery and AngularJS, but we’re open to people with all kinds of experience.<p>Please email: jobs@coursehero.com (and put “Hacker News” in the subject)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7590859 href="vote?for=7590859_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%6a%6d%41%61%7a%58%72%69%66%52%74%52%34%39%6c%4c%6e%58%4b%69%4f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7590859></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=atif089">atif089</a> 20 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7590859">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Close - We_#x27;re a tiny startup hiring in San Francisco.<p>We_#x27;re analyzing professional networks to help folks make the most of who they know. If you_#x27;ve ever tried to answer the question _quot;Who do I know that_#x27;s..._quot; (looking for engineers, investing in my kind of company, interested in partnerships, able to get me featured on Google Play, etc) -- that_#x27;s what we_#x27;re about.<p>It_#x27;s a huge, nutty data problem -- our professional networks aren_#x27;t perfectly manicured, exemplary LinkedIn accounts, but disparate and scattered across multiple platforms. Plus there_#x27;s the task of really trying to understand <i>who</i> everyone is, and figuring out a product perspective that avoids spam and creepiness while genuinely building relationships and value for both sides.<p>We recently closed a seed round and we_#x27;re looking for a Python data engineer and a Rails developer. If you_#x27;re interested in a rolling up your sleeves at a really early-stage startup (with funding!), we_#x27;d love to hear from you.<p>On the data side, ideally you have some experience with using Python for data analysis, scaling data tools, API integrations, machine learning_#x2F;natural language processing, and ontologies. For Rails, we_#x27;re looking for an experienced engineer who can own our Rails stack and lead integrations with our data backend.<p>If you_#x27;d like to learn more, please get in touch. I_#x27;m jennie at close.co, and I_#x27;m the data engineer you_#x27;d be working directly with in either role. :)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7508070 href="vote?for=7508070_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%6a%6d%41%61%7a%58%72%69%66%52%74%52%34%39%6c%4c%6e%58%4b%69%4f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7508070></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bkanber">bkanber</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7508070">link</a></span></div><br>

DOWNTOWN San Francisco
FULL TIME Engineers<p>WORK with CEO Richard Price
WORK with CTO Ben Lund
WORK with 9 Senior Engineers
WORK with the mission to make life better<p>BUILD a killer recommendation engine immersed in Machine Learning and NLP
BUILD our next major platform called “Peer Review” from Scratch
TACKLE all things related to Scalability, Storage, and Speed
VENTURE into mobile<p>HACK because that’s what you love to do
CONTRIBUTE to positive changes
OPEN SCIENCE, join ACADEMIA.EDU<p>We are Hiring a Team to Build a Better Future<p>Here at Academia.edu you will have an opportunity to join an agile team of 9 Engineers who are all making a positive impact on the world by contributing to a movement called Open Science.  As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.<p>We are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…<p>Peer Review<p>We want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.<p>To build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.<p>Interface Design<p>We currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.<p>Recommendation Engine<p>We have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.<p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.<p>Mobile App<p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!<p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.<p>Speed, Scale, _amp; Storage<p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.<p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.<p>Future at Academia.edu<p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. We_#x27;re based in Downtown San Francisco.<p>Chat with Ashley<p>If you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems then please do not hesitate to contact ashley[at]academia.edu.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7509702 href="vote?for=7509702_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%6a%6d%41%61%7a%58%72%69%66%52%74%52%34%39%6c%4c%6e%58%4b%69%4f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7509702></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=twymer">twymer</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7509702">link</a></span></div><br>

If you love designing and building modern, responsive web applications that make it easy for business users to run sophisticated investment analysis software, we would like to talk to you. We’re an established company with actual paying customers and we want to make our little corner of the world a better place for our users.<p>We use standards-based HTML, JavaScript and CSS to build a cross-browser UI. We use a lot of state of the art technology – HTML5, canvas, RequireJS, Backbone, LESS and node.js. The backend is a mixture of C#, Java, C++ because we believe in using the right tool for the job, and we are regularly evaluating our tools to ensure that. Our development process is agile and we release our web products approximately once a month.<p>Our offices are a five minute walk from the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe and Heavenly ski resort is a fifteen minute drive from the office. As a developer you’ll also get your own private office and even though we mostly develop on Windows, all our developers have Mac hardware.<p>We prefer to hire generalists who are as curious and excited about technology as we are. All of us enjoy learning new technologies and tools; we have a small team and each developer should be able to work on every aspect of the system.<p>Please note: this is a full-time, <i></i>on-site<i></i> position. We would prefer you to work in our Zephyr Cove office, but we also have offices in White Plains, NY or Nashville, TN that you could work out of. If you_#x27;re interested, please email matt.motherway -at- informais.com (and put “Hacker News” in the subject).

We_#x27;re starting this mission by targeting the enterprise, disrupting the fairly outdated enterprise education and training space, an industry that has over 60% of its customers dissatisfied with current products!<p>We_#x27;ve seen significant progress within our first year of business. We signed a Fortune 200, 30,000+ employee company to a six figure contract within our first months and successfully launched to that company a little over a month ago. They now have over 20% of their workforce using Pathgather.<p>Our product is built on top of a modern stack using best practices: an Angular client that communicates with a Rails 4 API, powered by Postgres, Redis, and Elasticsearch. We also have a strong focus on product and design (take a look at our product, and we think you_#x27;ll agree). Traditionally, enterprise software has lacked in these areas, but we aim to disrupt that tradition.<p>If you_#x27;re at all interested or curious in exploring an opportunity with us, please don_#x27;t hesitate to reach out to me at jamie@pathgather.com. We guarantee an amazing opportunity awaits: we_#x27;ll offer significant salary and equity, the chance to work on real problems experienced by a wide audience, opportunities for open source work and contributions, and influence in our product, culture, and vision from day one!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7509048 href="vote?for=7509048_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%46%59%57%36%30%49%68%79%78%50%51%46%32%58%54%69%36%55%43%79%46"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7509048></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rememberlenny">rememberlenny</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7509048">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Wanted:  Programming Unicorn.<p>We aren_#x27;t asking for much here at SwiftStack. All we need is someone that_#x27;s<p><pre><code>   * An experienced, opinionated crafter of scalable distributed systems
   * Possessed of a deep and abiding knowledge of Linux
   * A brilliant Python developer, steeped in the Web
   * Excited about deployment and knowledgeable about packaging and 
     the infrastructure that goes into getting nontrivial software systems 
     from _quot;here_quot; to _quot;there_quot;
   * Oh yeah, and it would be peachy if that person was really good at 
     front end development so they could give our users a smooth, 
     comprehensible experience that masks the inherent complexity 
     under the hood.
</code></pre>
(We_#x27;ll supply the horn.)<p>OK, maybe that is a big ask. It’s true, at a small (but growing) company, we do wear many hats, so the more you fit the above description, the better. But what we_#x27;re really looking for is a smart, talented, intellectually curious engineer with a strong background in at least one of the above skills and aspirations to grow in one or more of the others.<p>We_#x27;ve got a multi-talented engineering team and a host of compelling software-related challenges in many different arenas, and by the time you_#x27;re done here, you_#x27;ll have broad and deep enough experience that you_#x27;ll have earned your unicorn horn, and no can take that away from you. Because you_#x27;d stab them. With your unicorn horn.<p>Who the heck are we?<p>At SwiftStack we_#x27;re building software to help people create petabyte scale object storage infrastructure in their own data center instantaneously.  At our core, we use Swift, OpenStack_#x27;s object storage technology, but we_#x27;re building an orchestration layer that does the easy things for you, makes the hard things easy, and makes the impossible possible.<p>Why join SwiftStack?<p><pre><code>   * You_#x27;ll be part of a small team of highly skilled people who are also 
     very nice folks and would totally help you out in a pinch.
   * You_#x27;ll be joining a company at a perfect size -- just big enough to 
     have momentum, but small enough that the decisions you make will have 
     a real impact on its course.
   * You_#x27;ll get valuable experience building a product meant to manage massive 
     amounts of data. At scale, there are no easy problems.
   * Swift is Open Source technology, and part of one of the most important Open 
     Source initiatives in recent history: OpenStack. You_#x27;d be writing code that 
     people all over the world would use, including the likes of Wikipedia and CERN.

* Analysis_#x2F;Infrastructure_#x2F;Performance Focus - HALF-TIME with benefits<p>Verba believes in challenging the status quo of college textbooks. As it stands, every participant in the market lacks information, and the textbook market is even the basis for the definition of _quot;Broken Market_quot;.<p>By injecting information at precisely the right places, Verba is changing the landscape of higher education affordability: Getting professor book adoptions in faster; Giving recommendations on close-to-market bookstore prices; Helping students compare their bookstore_#x27;s prices to those of its online competitors; Sourcing cheaper books from online markets; Selling them back to multiple wholesalers <i>and</i> online markets.<p>We guide every stage of a book_#x27;s life. We help students save money, and bookstores become and stay relevant, competitive, and transparent.<p>Numbers: 350 colleges and universities, tracking ~200k unique ISBNs, serving millions of students, raising the _quot;win rate_quot; for bookstores to 80%, and dropping prices across the board. 17 employees, 3 part-time. 2 dogs. 5 cats. 3 children.<p>Code: Ruby, Rails, JS, Clojure for Hadoop, MySQL on AWS w_#x2F; Chef.

You_#x27;ve got strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture, and know enough JS to help out on front-end. A stats background, experience with Hadoop and knowledge of scheduling algorithms would be awesome, but not required.<p>How to get the job: Write a cover letter to jobs@verbasoftware.com that speaks to why this job might fit with you, and how you could help us out.

Both of those SDKs are open-source, as is tons of our codebase[1]. So if you enjoy working with smart people and getting to make a name for yourself releasing the things you work on to other developers, you_#x27;ve found the right place.<p>Not only that, but you_#x27;d be working on a few of our still-secret mobile projects that we_#x27;re pretty confident are going to change the way people integrate third party code into every mobile app they write afterwards.<p>[0]: <a href="https://segment.io" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;segment.io</a><p>[1]: <a href="https://github.com/segmentio" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;github.com_#x2F;segmentio</a><p>---<p>To apply, email us at jobs@segment.io with:<p><pre><code>    1. a description of an app you_#x27;ve worked on (code is a bonus)

VENTURE into mobile<p>HACK because that’s what you love to do<p>CONTRIBUTE to positive changes<p>OPEN SCIENCE, join ACADEMIA.EDU<p>We are Hiring a Team to Build a Better Future<p>Here at Academia.edu you will have an opportunity to join an agile team of 9 Engineers who are all making a positive impact on the world by contributing to a movement called Open Science.  As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.<p>We are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…<p>Peer Review<p>We want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.<p>To build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.<p>Interface Design<p>We currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.<p>Recommendation Engine<p>We have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.<p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.<p>Mobile App<p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!<p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.<p>Speed, Scale, _amp; Storage<p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.<p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.<p>Future at Academia.edu<p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. We_#x27;re based in Downtown San Francisco.<p>Chat with Ashley<p>If you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems then please do not hesitate to contact ashley[at]academia.edu.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7519725 href="vote?for=7519725_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%46%59%57%36%30%49%68%79%78%50%51%46%32%58%54%69%36%55%43%79%46"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7519725></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=IsaacL">IsaacL</a> 33 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7519725">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>yerdle - San Francisco<p>We_#x27;re hiring a whole-stack web developer. We_#x27;re a new kind of store—stocked from people_#x27;s closets and garages—where everything costs $0.<p><a href="https://yerdle.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;yerdle.com_#x2F;jobs</a><p><pre><code>    === About yerdle ===
</code></pre>
Why should we always buy new, when there are millions of perfectly great items sitting in closets and garages? How can we liberate these items and put them back into good use? How can we make sharing the new shopping?  This is why yerdle exists.  We help the world exchange second-hand goods for free. 80% of things in our homes are used once per month or less. The average power drill sees 6 minutes of use in its entire lifetime. There_#x27;s 3 billion ft² of self-storage space in the United States. That_#x27;s, like, two San Franciscos of usable stuff—just sitting there.  Yerdle is changing that. People on yerdle give away everything from kid’s clothes to kitchen tools and electronics. And we make it easier to get something re-used rather than buy new. We aim to replace 25% of new purchases with free, second-hand goods from others. In the process, we_#x27;re helping people save money and encouraging manufacturers to make better products.  We_#x27;re looking for people who are passionate about our vision and who want to use their skills to make the world a better place.<p><pre><code>    === Team and Culture ===
</code></pre>
We_#x27;ve been called _#x27;unrepentant hippies_#x27;—and that_#x27;s fine with us. This is a top-shelf engineering team building a great product in a fast-paced environment. We have developed deep trust and a lot of love as we_#x27;ve worked together. It_#x27;s a close-knit team, we like to pair, and we teach each other every day.  We have solid funding through incredible firms such as The Westly Group and Claremont Creek as well as angels with deep expertise such as Lisa Gansky, Adam Lowry and Andy Rappaport.<p><pre><code>    === Workflow and Process ===
</code></pre>
We_#x27;re agile, we do daily standup, regular one-on-ones and project retrospectives, and we have fun together—rock climbing, surfing, and hanging out after work over beers. As an engineer at yerdle, you_#x27;re more than a coder. You will influence the product_#x27;s direction, bring brilliant ideas and execute them.  We are polyglots, and most of our software is in Ruby, Objective-C, and JavaScript. We love to pair and we often let tests drive our development. And we code small (see our blog: <a href="http://codesmaller.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;codesmaller.com</a>).<p><pre><code>    === Hours and Schedule ===
</code></pre>
The day starts around 9am and we have a standup meeting at 10. We try to schedule any other meetings early or late in the day, so the middle of the day can be a great time to get the meat of the work done. Most people head out around 6pm, but some nights we work a little later. Though yerdle is a 24_#x2F;7 marketplace and we all have responsibilities in keeping it running smoothly, we try to keep our weekends clear as a time for R_amp;R.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7509423 href="vote?for=7509423_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%78%79%6e%41%77%69%68%6f%58%4b%53%33%39%35%61%34%55%7a%63%35%6f%6a"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7509423></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=silverthorn">silverthorn</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7509423">link</a></span></div><br>

We help students who have recently learnt programming build industrial strength software following best practices in software design and production. Our tools are tailored for a large population of students. We help them learn from each other. Our first focus area is software agents.

We have been in stealth mode and under the radar in Austin, but are going to grow in a big way fueled by determination, investment and, yes, even revenue(Redbull doesn_#x27;t hurt either).  We are looking for leaders to help us build out the future and this is the perfect opportunity for someone wanting to make a big splash for themselves.<p>We are a funded (<a href="http://www.liveoakvp.com/past-investment.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.liveoakvp.com_#x2F;past-investment.html</a>) SaaS company that is simplifying customer support through personalized help via machine learning(ML), natural language processing(NLP), effortless identity and analytics.<p>Our stack is Django_#x2F;Python, Postgres, Redis, Angular and Salt, but are also looking to expand this as we expand the solution. We believe in constantly learning, so if you have any great ideas about new tools that we should be using then we will certainly listen. We are not quite continuous deployment(currently on weekly schedules), but are working towards that. We practice TDD, code reviews and believe in automating everything.<p>We are currently hiring for:<p>* Django_#x2F;Python developers to help us build out some immense backend services as well as dabble in mounds of machine learning.  You will have the opportunity to jump around to all aspects of the stack if you want or you can sink your teeth into areas such as large scale data pipelines, data analysis and visualizations, sentiment analysis of content through natural language processing, sub-second real-time highly dimensional recommender systems or an intelligent SLA bound context discovery engine.

We don_#x27;t have walls up between operations and development so this is a perfect role for those developers out there wanting to dip into DevOps or the DevOps engineers who like to stretch their development side as much as their operations side.<p>* Client side developers to help us build out both our worldwide mobile web application presence as well as our web based management tool.  We leverage Backbone, Angular, SASS, Bootstrap and D3.js in our tool belts.  You would have a strong role in defining the future for these applications as they are both in their early stages and are in strong need of a passionate developer who wants to build a critical piece of our solution from the ground up.  In the next year you will also have the opportunity to build highly interactive data visualizations using D3.js to help bubble insights up out of both ad hoc data queries as well as offline analytics from the data streams from our systems as well as our large scale enterprise customers.<p>We offer the following:<p>*  Competitive salaries<p>*  Equity<p>*  Health Insurance<p>*  Equipment budget<p>*  Flexible vacation schedule<p>*  A flexible working schedule<p>*  Education_#x2F;conference opportunities<p>*  A passionate team<p>*  And more...<p>If you are interested, please send an email to erik@steponeinc.com and come help us build the next Austin success story!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7523084 href="vote?for=7523084_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%78%79%6e%41%77%69%68%6f%58%4b%53%33%39%35%61%34%55%7a%63%35%6f%6a"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7523084></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=chourobin">chourobin</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7523084">link</a></span></div><br>

The office is located in SOMA in San Francisco.<p>=============<p>Frontend Engineer at Prismatic: iOS, Web, and Android. <a href="http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5971" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io_#x2F;prismatic_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;5971</a><p>==<p>Strong CS basics in data structures and algorithms. Strong engineering; thoughtful design and clean code. Graphics, browser, games, or animation experience a big plus.
A front-end engineer that has a strong computer science background, but wants to focus on product engineering rather than backend systems. You don’t want to just take off the shelf UI components, but want to explore new interactions. You aren’t afraid to dig under the hood of iOS frameworks or browser code in order to make an animation or interaction feel natural and smooth.<p>=============<p>Backend Engineer at Prismatic: <a href="http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5976" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io_#x2F;prismatic_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;5976</a><p>==<p>Prismatic is a great place to be a backend engineer - we analyze millions of shared web pages every day, automatically classify them into tens of thousands of topics, and serve up personalized feeds in real-time using our homegrown, lightning fast, machine learning-based relevance engine. We are looking to grow our top-notch team, with both junior and senior-level positions available.
We are looking for engineers with deep interest and knowledge in at least one area core to our business (i.e., distributed systems, ops and tooling, machine learning, designing and building new product features). We’re a small team, so you will have the opportunity to have a lot of impact, and to learn from peers who are extremely talented engineers, computer scientists, and data experts. Our backend is written entirely in Clojure, a JVM-based LISP that is a dream to work in. Almost none of us knew it before we joined, and we don’t expect you to either. We do, however, expect the following:
- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess. - You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs. - You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful. - You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two. - You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are. - You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.
Here’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:
- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive - Building out new product features in our API - Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly - Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more - Creating tools to assist development and ops - Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better<p>We are also looking for designers, visual and_#x2F;or interaction.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7508003 href="vote?for=7508003_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%78%79%6e%41%77%69%68%6f%58%4b%53%33%39%35%61%34%55%7a%63%35%6f%6a"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7508003></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=LeslieOA">LeslieOA</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7508003">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>REMOTE. Contract to hire and FTE web developer positions.<p>I work for a small elite consultancy called Twin Technologies. We_#x27;re about 25 FTEs and 40 contractors. I settled here after working in multiple startups, contracting for a larger consultancy, and even co-running my own consultancy and incubator. I came back to Twin after a year hiatus because this is really as good as it gets. The leadership is fantastic, and work-life balance is deeply ingrained in the culture. On top of that, I can honestly say that I enjoy working with my entire team and look forward to our three yearly get-togethers.<p>We_#x27;re very selective with who we hire, but if you_#x27;re reading this then it_#x27;s a good start that you_#x27;re on Hacker News. For the record I_#x27;m not a recruiter or HR for Twin - I_#x27;m a tech lead. We_#x27;ve got some big projects in the pipeline and need to find the right people to join us ASAP. Drop me a line if you_#x27;re interested. Also drop me a line is you have any general questions about tech consulting.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Boston, MA<p>A little about us - we_#x27;re called “Change Collective” and are a Boston startup. We are building a course platform that helps people make changes that matter with the help of world-class experts. Our goal is to transform the way people change. We_#x27;re backed by the best investors in Boston, and already count among our experts a NY Times best-selling author.<p>About you - you are a software engineer, programmer, architect, coder, or some or all of the above. Ultimately you, and the rest of the team around you, will love to learn, improve, refine and grow as a craftsman and professionals. You will get paid competitively. You will receive some equity in a young (funded) company. You will write a lot of Ruby, Javascript, markup and some Sass. You love Git, Github, Heroku, Trello (as much as one can love organizational tools), code reviews, occasional pair programming and open source. Although our stack does not currently include the following, there is a strong chance we will experiment with technologies like Ember.js, Angular, GoLang, Node, or the right tool for the job. We know for sure that there will plenty of native app development for iOS, Android and interaction with wearable devices. Right now we_#x27;re quickly becoming enamored with Rubymotion. We almost pass the Joel Spolsky test - nobody_#x27;s perfect (#7 needs some work). And we_#x27;re firm believers in working smart, sustainable, hours.<p>This would be a job local to Boston for now (near South Station _#x2F; Chinatown) as we_#x27;re a small team in a very collaborative environment.<p>If you like bullet points:<p>You are confident, comfortable and enjoy writing ruby, javascript, html and css
You practice test driven development
You are process driven, but not dogmatic
Required - you possess a healthy urge to get better, and help others get better, at their craft
Not required (but won_#x27;t be held against you) - a university degree
We provide a competitive salary, equity and freedom to use the tools (hardware and software) that you consider best for your work.
We_#x27;re building a company that will live and breathe change and offer excellent opportunities for you to improve personally and professionally.<p>If you often wake up with an intense desire to improve your life and the lives of others, and regularly act on it — that_#x27;s our mission — email us (ben@changecollective.com and joel@changecollective.com) and say _quot;hello_quot;.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7626978 href="vote?for=7626978_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%78%79%6e%41%77%69%68%6f%58%4b%53%33%39%35%61%34%55%7a%63%35%6f%6a"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7626978></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=TheHunter">TheHunter</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7626978">link</a></span></div><br>

At Docker Inc, we believe that containerization will soon become the next big thing, the next tool which will be part of every developer and sysadmin toolbox. What_#x27;s _quot;containerization_quot;? The name comes the LXC technology (Linux Containers), and the technique is also known as _quot;Lightweight Virtualization_quot;.<p>That_#x27;s why we launched Docker (<a href="http://www.docker.io/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.docker.io_#x2F;</a>), an Open Source tool enabling anyone to run those Linux Containers very easily. Containers boot 1000x faster than virtual machines; their disk and memory footprint are also much lower; and they work on virtually all current platforms (from physical servers to public cloud instances). We think that they are the future of virtualization, and will soon become ubiquitous.<p>Convinced? Then fork the repo on github (<a href="https://github.com/dotcloud/docker" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;github.com_#x2F;dotcloud_#x2F;docker</a>) and have a look at the code. Not convinced? Then check the website (<a href="http://www.docker.io/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.docker.io_#x2F;</a>), which contains more details, demos, and screencasts. Excited about this? Then join our engineering team!<p>Your responsibilities will include:<p>- being a contributor to the Docker project, which means contributing patches, and reviewing and merging pull requests from the community;<p>- working on some server-side applications; participate in product discussions, influence the roadmap, and take ownership and responsibility over new projects to make them happen.<p>You can qualify if you...:<p>- can read and write Go code (because docker itself is in Go);<p>- can read and write Python code (because many tools and services built around Docker are in Python);<p>- are familiar with network protocols: the lower layers like IP, TCP, and UDP; and the higher layers like HTTP;<p>- have experience in scaling large applications;<p>- believe that writing unit and functional tests is important.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7522558 href="vote?for=7522558_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%78%79%6e%41%77%69%68%6f%58%4b%53%33%39%35%61%34%55%7a%63%35%6f%6a"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7522558></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=babo">babo</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7522558">link</a></span></div><br>

Here’s a snapshot of some of the things we_#x27;re currently working on, will be working on soon, or maybe just finished.<p>- Updating the entire online pre-stay experience for guests (we call it, online check-in)<p>- Launched a brand new online magazine with custom cms called The Edition<p>- Developed an authentication and staff management system to handle our ever-growing team<p>- Completely revamping the entire site to support mobile devices (40% of our traffic comes from iOS)<p># who do we want?<p>We_#x27;re looking for someone who can question the status quo, bring new ideas to the table, see the full potential of a new feature (and push it to realisation), or if necessary tone down something that is getting out of hand.

There_#x27;s a bunch of other stuff that will go a long way to get us excited:<p>- Experience with source control (git, mercurial)<p>- Experience with agile development methodologies<p>- Comfortable working with pre-processors such as browserify, React_#x27;s jsx format<p>- Experience with CI and automated testing (jenkins, jasmine)<p># what we can offer you?<p>- Competitive salaries<p>- Stock options<p>- A social work environment filled to the brim with talented developers<p>- Your choice of dev environment (on the penthouse floor of our sweet new offices)<p>- Time to expand and grow your skills<p>Interested?

<span class="comment"><font color=#5a5a5a>Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do _quot;expense reports that don_#x27;t suck!_quot; (Google _quot;expensify_quot; to read more.) We_#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren_#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it_#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won_#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn_#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We_#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We_#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing_#x2F;designing_#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you_#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you_#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you_#x27;re this sort of person, you_#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn_#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That_#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it_#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I_#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don_#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href="http://we.are.expensify.com/apply" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;we.are.expensify.com_#x2F;apply</a>). We are excited to hear from you!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_7511258 href="vote?for=7511258_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%43%5a%73%4c%77%36%30%5a%4f%30%35%33%43%6c%6e%4e%72%65%72%6f%61%70"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id=down_7511258></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=morningstar">morningstar</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7511258">link</a></span></div><br>

We have a seed-stage investment fund, a small hedge fund, and three startups (one consumer internet, one enterprise financial services, and one consumer packaged goods) - you will have the opportunity to work on all of them. Our backgrounds are varied - one former venture capitalist, one hedge fund analyst, one former consultant with a successful startup exit, one corporate _#x2F; M_amp;A lawyer, one Ph.D, and one musician_#x2F;startup junkie. We all are friends and started working together in the past year - we have a lot of fun together which makes work a breeze.<p>You should be results-driven and analytical, with a willingness to learn new skills: For the intern and analyst role, we need people to be sales-driven who write web content, collect customer feedback, and research markets. The associate role is for someone who can establish partnerships, help investment diligence, and get dirty building models in excel.<p>Like the rest of us on the team, you should be in love with the Internet and everything you can do with it. You should enjoy solving tricky problems and be a great communicator, in person, on the phone and in writing. You should be analytical and willing to take on a bunch of different things.<p>We_#x27;re looking for a few different roles: one would be a recent college grad who is ready for the startup experience, and another for someone with a couple of years of experience in banking or consulting. We_#x27;re also open to the idea of an intern. The position is full-time and reports directly to successful serial entrepreneurs.<p>You’ll work from our headquarters in the mission district of San Francisco (or remotely for the right person... perhaps someone with an ultimate goal to move to SF).<p>Competitive compensation with $$ and equity for the right candidate – probably beginning as a contractor and moving to full time as the business scales. There will also be massive opportunity professional growth as you learn the ins and outs of scaling a startup. If this describes you and the opportunity seems exciting, lets talk! Send an email to thisisanewfund@gmail.com to introduce yourself. We’ll be happy to fill you on the details of our companies and tell you more about the opportunities.

We_#x27;ve been around since 2005 as myYearbook, rebranding in 2012 as MeetMe. We_#x27;ve launched other apps such as Choosy, Charm, and Unsaid in the past few months, and are looking to continue adding more standalone apps in the future.<p>We use a wide variety of languages, generally using what makes sense. C, PHP, Python, JavaScript and Node.js, and native iOS and Android development are the most common.<p>MeetMe is a fun place to work. We hold a yearly developer retreat, as well as regular company-wide hackathons. We have a book club, board game club, and we even have a game room. While we aren_#x27;t a new company in the time scale of the internet, we still know how to have fun. We just get the benefit of not having to kill ourselves working 12 hour days. =) This means you_#x27;ll enjoy actually going home on time!
