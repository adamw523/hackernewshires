<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA. Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Almost every technological and medical innovation in the world has its roots in a scientific paper. Science drives much of the world’s innovation. The faster science moves, the faster the world moves.<p>It's widely held that science is too slow, and too closed. We are working on changing that, and re-inventing the way that scientists communicate. The stakes are high. If the inefficiencies in science can be removed, we may be able to accelerate science by a factor of 2, leading to a huge impact for humanity.<p>For more on the problem Academia.edu is solving, see the guest post on TechCrunch last Sunday on 'The Future of Science' by Academia.edu's founder, Richard Price <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/</a><p>Academia.edu has over 1.2 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.<p>We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812</a>. Some of our angel investors include Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) and Rupert Pennant-Rea (Chairman of The Economist).<p>We need talented engineers to come and help us with the mission. We have a strong engineering culture. We're an 11 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is in Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href="http://academia.edu/hiring" rel="nofollow">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.<p>The kinds of things you would be working on include:<p>★ tools for scientists to share their work faster and more openly<p>★ algorithms to mine our data, and to find out what research is trending in real time<p>★ back-end infrastructure to scale the site on AWS<p>What we're looking for are:<p>☀ 2+ years of web development experience<p>☀ Experience with the full engineering stack<p>☀ Passion for engineering<p>All the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue. You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them. If you like having an impact, you will enjoy the Academia.edu culture.<p>There is more information here <a href="http://academia.edu/hiring" rel="nofollow">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Factual is hiring in Palo Alto, Los Angeles, and Shanghai. Local candidates preferred, but remote work is possible for exceptional U.S. candidates. Full-time only. H1B is okay for very strong, non-remote applicants.<p>Factual's vision is to be an awesome and affordable data provider, so that developers, startups, and big companies can focus on innovation instead of data acquisition. We believe in openness and transparency rather than proprietariness and obfuscation.
We have a terrific team that is still fairly small, and an incredible CEO (he was the co-founder of Applied Semantics, which was sold to Google and became AdSense).<p>In late 2010, we raised a Series A from Andreessen-Horowitz, and our customers and partners include Facebook, Newsweek, Yelp, and Blekko. We have lots of challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, deduping, storage, serving, APIs, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be.<p>We have job openings for software engineers of all levels. You would ideally know Java and/or Clojure, and you'll get bonus points for experience with machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop.<p>If you're interested in the Bay Area office, it just opened in December of 2011 and is very small, so you'd have a significant influence on the culture there.<p>You can email me personally at leo -at- factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:<p>Palo Alto Software Engineer: <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq_#38;s=Hackernews" rel="nofollow">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oTR1Vfwq_#38;s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Software engineer: <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn_#38;s=Hackernews" rel="nofollow">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn_#38;s=Hackernews</a><p>Los Angeles Data Engineer: <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq_#38;s=Hackernews" rel="nofollow">http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oSS1Vfwq_#38;s=Hackernews</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3914488 href="vote?for=3914488_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%39%31%33%39%39%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3914488></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=btucker">btucker</a> 397 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3914488">link</a></span></div><br>

We get our changes out really fast, it's rare for your code not to be on our live systems within hours of you pushing it.<p>We're also very open to open sourcing code that doesn't contain any business logic, I've personally been involved in open sourcing a few of our internal tools, including <a href="https://github.com/git-deploy" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/git-deploy</a> and a few CPAN modules.<p>We have a relatively flat hierarchy with minimum levels of bureaucracy since we're very data driven and have a clear goal: helping our customers. Everything we do is aimed at solving problems for our customers, if it doesn't help our customers we're not interested in doing it.<p>You don't have to know Perl in advance to be a developer there. We've hired people who've done C, Java etc. before. The sort of people we'd like to hire are good technically, excellent at communication, and can acquire a good sense of how they fit into the big picture.<p>I'd be happy to answer any questions at avarab@gmail.com and/or forward your resume, I've posted in a similar thread here a couple of times before and have already helped get one person hired, many others have had or are having interviews, and I've fielded a bunch of questions from would-be applicants. <a href="http://booking.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">http://booking.com/jobs</a> also has some good information.<p>1.

If you are a vim user, we have the programmer who wrote Command-T on staff and he's a great person to learn from - every changeset gets pushed to Gerrit where it waits to get a +1 from our build suite (that runs in 3 minutes) and a +1 from a human reviewer<p>- last month I said we were hoping to finish our Rails 3.0.11 upgrade soon. I'm happy to announce that not only have we landed on 3.2.3, but we needed some upstream patches to get our site working -- so we're on bleeding edge Rails. We're the largest site I know of on Rails 3.2. Come get your SASS on!<p>- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise<p>- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Mapquest Vibe - <a href="http://mqvibe.mapquest.com" rel="nofollow">http://mqvibe.mapquest.com</a><p>Denver, CO - Fulltime.<p>Mapquest is hiring engineers to work on a new product, Mapquest Vibe. Vibe was just released at SxSW and we have a lot of work to do before we can strip the "beta" label off. If Mapquest answers the question "How do I get from A to B", Vibe answers the question "Where do I want to go?" Using Vibe, you can see at a glance where the best businesses are in any neighborhood - our goal is that it will help users feel like a "local" wherever they wind up.<p>You'll have a lot of autonomy in terms of how you implement features as well as input into the product direction itself. Projects I've implemented are a semantic tagging system to help categorize businesses, a dynamic geographic buffer to allow for fuzzy location searching, and I'm currently implementing a new API intended for public consumption. It's a very empowering culture and a great place to work.<p>We're hiring across the board. Front-end folks use backbone.js, jQuery and a few mapping-specific toolkits to do various things. Back-end folks use a mixture of Java (running on Play!) and Groovy talking to a Postgres DB. Right now we're doing mobile development for the iPhone, with an Android app on the horizon. Experience matters less than ability - we'd be just as happy interviewing a grad right out of school as we would be interviewing a grizzled vet with 40 years experience. Skills I would particularly like to see added to the team are knowledge of Hadoop and Lucene, but that's my own personal wish-list.<p>If you're interested, shoot me an e-mail (it's in my profile).</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3914416 href="vote?for=3914416_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%39%31%33%39%39%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3914416></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mikenyc">mikenyc</a> 397 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3914416">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Peek (www.peek.ly) - Manhattan, NY (interns, part-time, full-time, H1B welcome)<p>Peek wants to make the Internet and data available globally via mobile devices. We want people in the most remote regions of the world to obtain $50 or even $25 devices to communicate and collect the data they need. This means that we need to make software that is affordable and uses as little data as possible. But is still incredibly powerful! It's a big challenge.<p>At Peek we are looking for software engineers who have a passion for the startup environment, and who want to develop skills on new and emerging technology while learn more about what it takes to start a successful company.<p>What we're looking for?<p>1. You love to create. You will code and build mobile apps on the hottest mobile platform in the world (and it's not iOS or Android... hmmm), it's an SDK used in 40% of the phones in the global market (and growing 50% year over year). You'll also work on our cloud systems, hosted in Amazon AWS and learn all about mobile to cloud applications, and handling scale on the order of millions of clients. We use C/C++, Java, .NET, Ruby, Javascript (including node.js), and many others.<p>2. You are eager to do it all and make an impact: product and feature planning, development, project management and of course, testing (we all do it!)<p>3. You are "smart and gets things done" (and can name the guy who coined that phrase)<p>4. You want to be part of a startup - this means a very small organization with a flat hierarchy where you can communicate freely and openly.<p>What's in it for you?<p>1. A very competitive salary, great health care (incl. vision and dental), stock options, group events (like ping pong nights) and a great working environment in Manhattan, New York.<p>2. The opportunity to work on every aspect of a mobile operation, including embedded (C/C++), back-end (Java, node.js), cloud systems (EC2), and more. You'll get a chance to work on all of these systems, not just one or two.<p>3. Our founders, who have raised over $100m in capital in their careers, will show you the start-up ropes, do sessions with you, and introduce you to folks in the startup community - entrepreneurs, VCs, etc. And when you want to start your next big startup, we'll be there to help you out.<p>Peek launched nation-wide in the US, in late 2008. Since then we’ve launched successfully across Europe and in India, and picked up many awards along the way including Time's Gadget of the Year, Wired Product of the Year, and GSMA nomination for Best Cloud Technology. Peek is backed by top-tier venture capital firms RRE Ventures and L Capital, and led by the founder of Virgin Mobile USA (IPO 2007; acquired by Sprint).<p>Send us an email to jobs@peek.ly</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3914137 href="vote?for=3914137_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%39%31%33%39%39%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3914137></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=simonholroyd">simonholroyd</a> 397 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3914137">link</a></span></div><br>

The ability to effectively collaborate with multidisciplinary project teams to enable all participants to feel equally invested in strategies and executions and keep everyone in the know and in a position to succeed

An insatiable curiosity and knowledge about all things social, web, and mobile
The ability to write concisely and with a strong voice, without typo or delay with general editorial sensibilities
An interest and comfort level in standing in front of a client or a room full of peers and giving their opinion or a presentation

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's tempting to say "Oh yes, definitely," but that wouldn't be completely honest. The real answer is, of course, much more nuanced than that.<p>It's not the totally unfettered we-do-what-we-want-when-we-want-to Wild West that was Ksplice-the-startup, but it is still a small, tight-knit team with a lot of autonomy, and I think the small-team aspect is a huge component of what makes a startup so fun.<p>Of course, the transition to big-company has its benefits. For example: benefits (see what I did there?), an HR department so that we can hire people internationally, a sizeable budget, and the ability to focus on the things that are core to what we're doing without having to worry about all of the overhead associated with running the company.<p>Not to mention the legitimacy benefits: a few years ago, we had a meeting with BigFinancialCo and they basically told us: "Yes, we love your product and we want to run it, but look, we're BigFinancialCo and we spend a zillion dollars on IT. As much as we want to, we just can't run some product made by people who work out of what appears to be some sort of co-ed MIT nerd frathouse in Cambridge." Which, fair enough -- the house was pretty gross.<p>Now that we're Oracle, it's much more of an, ah, how shall I put this, "no one got fired for buying IBM" situation. (Yes, I see the irony in that statement.) Any technical skepticism is easily dispensed with, because we credibly have the support resources to back up the product.<p>My job in particular is definitely one that has probably changed the most: I no longer do day-to-day sales stuff (the Oracle Linux sales team does it all), and as a result I get to focus a lot more on product management, only tactically dropping in on customer meetings when it makes sense.<p>By contrast, the day-to-day of our engineering team here at Oracle is actually extremely similar to how it was at Ksplice. Which hopefully answers your question :)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3919650 href="vote?for=3919650_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%39%31%33%39%39%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3919650></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=eli_gottlieb">eli_gottlieb</a> 396 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3919650">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Fluidshopping - Berlin - Fulltime - CTO<p>We are a Berlin-based startup working on next-generation testing and user experience. At Fluidshopping, we want to make split testing easy for web shop owners.<p>This includes test that change the business rules, not the GUI. For example, you may want to test if sending a $10 voucher to those who buy _#62;$50 will have an effect on chance of repeated buy. Or you want to test the effect of free shipping when they bought _#62;$100. As far as we know, these tests are not easy without tinkering with the current shopping cart software setup. We want to make this as easy as testing the GUI and UX elements (design, copy).<p>We use lean startup methods, and can systematically test hypotheses on any market. Our approach is the ‘startup of startups’, that is, iterate fast and discard what doesn’t work, even if the new product looks like a completely new application (and startup!). We have runway for a year. We are two people, and have been funded for only two months. We have offices in Berlin, but we often work from home.<p>We are looking for a technical cofounder (CTO) to disrupt the ecommerce analytics market with us and to receive a forthcoming EXIST schoolarship (2000-2500€/person/month) for one year. We are two people, one of us is technical, with a PhD in machine learning.<p>Responsibilities:<p>Your responsibilities will be to work on new key features, help us scale, contribute to the product and optimize performance. You’ll be the CTO in an agile development environment. The job offers lots of challenges because we build a real-time collaborative tool in a large market that is ripe for disruption.<p>As the CTO, you set the technology. Our current MVP is Django. We need to interface with shopping carts, and when the API is not enough, that means some PHP may be unavoidable.
What we like:
- node.js
- Mongo or similar NoSQL db
- jQuery
- JavaScript
- python/django
- Backbone.js
- Familiarity with HTML5 (websockets)<p>Perks:
- Work from home as much as you want
- … but have a nice office, with terrace and BBQ
- Stock options in two-digit range
- Dog
 - In the center of the Berlin startup ecosystem (we organize events such as demodinner)<p>For more see <a href="http://fluidshopping.com/blog/about-fluidshopping/" rel="nofollow">http://fluidshopping.com/blog/about-fluidshopping/</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3917007 href="vote?for=3917007_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%39%31%33%39%39%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3917007></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ryen">ryen</a> 396 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3917007">link</a></span></div><br>

Full-time candidates only, local preferred strongly over remote, relocation possible for the right candidate.<p>Stitch Fix is a totally new way to shop -- check out our video (<a href="http://bit.ly/GSelpp" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/GSelpp</a>) for a quick introduction to our service. Here's how we do it: Our clients provide us with details about their size and personal style. Once a month they are offered a Fix: for a $20 styling fee we hand select 5 items using a combination of our proprietary styling algorithm professional stylists and send it to their home. If a customer chooses to buy one or more pieces, the $20 styling fee is a credit toward their purchase. Lots of additional detail is available in our faq (<a href="http://bit.ly/JaVIM6" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/JaVIM6</a>).  Our clients love the service and the business is exploding. We have thousands of paying clients, business doubled from November to April, will double again by September, and we will grow faster in 2013. We just raised our Series A from top-tier VC firm to invest in scaling engineering, operations, and merchandising -- which is where you might come in.<p>We are building the team that is going to take us to 10x by the end of next year. We are looking for folks that get super excited about jumping in the deep end, building outstanding products, and delighting clients. In Engineering we're big fans of Continuous Deployment, Specializing Generalists, and people that know the difference between hacking together technology and consistently delivering world-class products. We like people that take their work seriously but aren't serious at work. We believe the best products are delivered when engineers are empowered to solve problems, involved in how the business works and have a clear connection to their customer. The engineering team is currently a data and analytics engineer, a front end engineer/designer, and a generalist engineer. We are in the process of moving from a Linode/Django/jQuery architecture to AWS/Rails/(ember|backbone|similar) and beyond that we have <i>lots</i> of new products to build and will need to incorporate a bunch of new technology to get there.
We are looking for 2 more great generalist engineers, ideally with Rails experience but it's not a requirement.<p>If you're interested please send an email to jobs@stitchfix.com.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3914729 href="vote?for=3914729_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%53%59%37%35%73%54%38%41%52%79%39%46%33%66%78%59%78%63%4e%4e%63%6f"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3914729></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=matrix">matrix</a> 397 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3914729">link</a></span></div><br>

It's incredibly fun because we get to build a database <i>from scratch</i>, and we get to do some really cool stuff with distributed systems.<p>We’re obsessed with building pragmatic things that work in “the real world” and joining them with the most cutting-edge distributed systems research. We’ve built and run some of the largest companies and infrastructures: Sun, Amazon, Google, Intel, and more. Even the CEO codes almost every day.<p>Engineer: Database Core / Distributed Systems: San Francisco<p>Help our core team build a database from the ground up. Finally, you can do things “the way they should be”. Instead of a db from the 1980′s, we’re creating a platform for modern, real-time applications.<p>Here are some things you may enjoy doing or learning about:<p>-Building query planners and optimizers
-Compiler design
-Functional programming (Scala, Clojure, etc.)
-Distributed systems architecture: failover, replication
-JVM tuning and performance hacks
-Turning academic research into reality
-Resilient systems for the real world
-Engineer: Operations and Automation: San Francisco<p>Yes, this is a “DevOps” role. If you like coding <i>and</i> systems work, you’re going to enjoy this. You’ll be the one responsible for building clusters that heal themselves and deploy seamlessly in the cloud or customer sites.<p>-Cluster automation
-Deployment frameworks like Chef, Puppet, CFEngine
-Building monitoring tools that you enjoy using
-Upgrading and recovering from failure with no downtime
-How to make Linux behave
-Hadoop/HBase/BigTable/other distributed systems
-And perhaps a bit of UX hackin’</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3915991 href="vote?for=3915991_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%53%59%37%35%73%54%38%41%52%79%39%46%33%66%78%59%78%63%4e%4e%63%6f"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3915991></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jzoidberg">jzoidberg</a> 396 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3915991">link</a></span></div><br>

From NoSQL to Backbone to Node.  You aren't technically religious and gain as much satisfaction in picking the right tool for the job as you do implementing it.<p>You've built stuff. Web sites. Mobile apps. Whatever. You can show us. You can't wait to show us. You're not only excited of the what users can do with it, you're proud about how it's implemented and to a technical audience, you can't wait to talk about it.<p>As part of the first engineering team, you're excited by the prospect of working with smart people. Because you're smart and you know it - and you know that working with other smart people simply makes you better (all the while making them better too). As a bonus, being part of this initial team gives you the opportunity to strongly affect future engineering hires - insuring the caliber of the team.<p>You live within commuting distance to Palo Alto, CA or are willing to relocate (paid).<p><a href="http://www.refresh.io/jobs" rel="nofollow">http://www.refresh.io/jobs</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3914197 href="vote?for=3914197_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%53%59%37%35%73%54%38%41%52%79%39%46%33%66%78%59%78%63%4e%4e%63%6f"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3914197></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tpimental">tpimental</a> 397 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3914197">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>PhotoShelter - New York, NY (Full-time)<p>PhotoShelter provides tools to help photographers display, market, sell, and distribute their photos. We're a small company with a laid-back atmosphere (we love dogs and barbecue) located right on Union Square, in the heart of the city.<p>We are looking for both back-end and front-end engineers to help grow our product. We value folks who are passionate about and take pride in their craft, more than buzzword compliance. Our stack includes css, html5, javascript (with a homegrown MVC framework) on the front-end, and PHP, some C, PostgreSQL, Sphinx and Memcached on the back-end. While specific experience with any of those is a plus, we want engineers who write quality code and design clean solutions.<p>Our diverse staff includes veteran engineers from HotJobs and Yahoo, one of Computerworld's 40 Under 40 tech innovators, and even a well-known concert photographer. We offer competitive salaries, stock options, bonuses, great benefits, and try to grab dinner together (on the company!) every few weeks.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>When this application was started around 2008 or so we had a number of frameworks to choose from. At the time we chose spring.net. Looking back on it, that was a good choice considering most of our alternatives at the time (and since) have come and gone. Particularly Microsoft technologies that seem to come and go all the time. We're pretty happy that we chose a reliable, stable and well-maintained library such as spring.net.<p>I am curious what alternative you'd recommend, particularly if it's something that is production ready and has a certain future.<p>We're well aware of how hard it is to hire good C# developers. But in my opinion, a good C# developer isn't going to be put off by the choice of Spring.NET.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3916370 href="vote?for=3916370_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%55%55%67%35%42%55%47%57%48%42%70%36%49%37%58%48%61%71%73%36%38%5a"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3916370></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=solutionyogi">solutionyogi</a> 396 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3916370">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think Spring.NET is too verbose and too big. I would rather use few well tested and idiomatic C# frameworks as an alternative to Spring.NET<p>E.g. IOC - You can use MEF which is part of the framework. OR my personal favorite Ninject.<p>Web Applications - Without a doubt ASP.NET MVC.<p>Aspect Oriented Programming - Postsharp<p>DataAccess - I do not think ORM technology is mature enough to use it for any complicated work. For simpler things, Dapper does the trick.<p>I believe in using best tool for a given problem instead of using one monolithic framework. I especially don't like Spring framework because it needs too much configuration in terms of XML files. I prefer configuration through code approach.<p>Email me if you want to discuss more.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3915806 href="vote?for=3915806_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%55%55%67%35%42%55%47%57%48%42%70%36%49%37%58%48%61%71%73%36%38%5a"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3915806></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=cperea">cperea</a> 396 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3915806">link</a></span></div><br>

We want to fix this problem using an alternative East meets West adaptive curriculum, and we could use your help.<p>We're a NYC startup, a bit different from the Silicon Valley boys, more results oriented, less fluff and you can bet that everyone on your team is as talented and driven as you. We have awesome proprietary technology and architecture that's going to make a huge impact on math e-Learning and are already working with several schools, organizations, and private consumers. They agree what we have works.<p>This is your chance to "do good by doing good"-- get competitive compensation, cash + equity, and make a real difference in the world.<p>Like everyone and their grandmothers, we're looking for talented engineers, Javascript/PHP/AJAX/MySQL. Bonus points if you're UX oriented and have a keen eye for cool design or hopped on the iOS SDK early and are a guru at objective C.<p>You gotta be laid back, we're all going to be spending long hours together and don't want to work with anyone too high strung.
