<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">New York _#x2F; London - Bloomberg<p><a href="http://jobs.bloomberg.com/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;jobs.bloomberg.com_#x2F;</a> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/ux" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.bloomberg.com_#x2F;ux</a><p>There are many jobs open at Bloomberg, but I_#x27;m particularly looking for intelligent software engineers and UX professionals to work under the CTO and Infrastructure team in R_amp;D. We have roughly 4,000 R_amp;D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level _quot;app_quot; development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we_#x27;re evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We_#x27;re helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we_#x27;ve rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.<p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we_#x27;re a tiny percentage of the overall R_amp;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC_#x27;s Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion _quot;ticks_quot; daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one _quot;feed_quot;) from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication_#x2F;subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)<p>We could use a motto like _quot;We do a lot of stuff._quot;<p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. I_#x27;ll be sponsoring _#x2F; attending RobotsConf in December, too.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6654508" href="vote?for=6654508_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%36%35%33%34%33%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6654508"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=grosbisou">grosbisou</a> 263 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6654508">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">_gt; - You believe the actor-model concurrency is a better idea.<p>Better than using stateful concurrency? If you have read _quot;Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming_quot; you would see that each approach is not necessarily _quot;better_quot;, they each have their own unique advantages and disadvantages<p>To quote from CTM:
    The message-passing approach is often the 
best for multi-agent programs, i.e., programs that consist of autonomous entities
(“agents”) that communicate with each other. The shared-state approach is often
the best for data-centered programs, i.e., programs that consist of a large repository
of data (“database”) that is accessed and updated concurrently. Both approaches
can be used together for different parts of the same application.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6669236" href="vote?for=6669236_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%36%35%33%34%33%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6669236"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ssudore">ssudore</a> 260 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6669236">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Agave Lab -- Guadalajara Mexico.<p>We_#x27;re an early stage product incubator located in sunny Guadalajara, Mexico that was founded by an ex-Bay Area startup exec 4 years ago. We turn out products, about 3-4 per year, based on our own ideas. The ones that go well, we reinvest in. Those that don_#x27;t, we bury in the yard. We also invest in, mentor, and incubate local startups targeting the Latin American market. We_#x27;re at the center of the rapidly emerging startup boom in Mexico. Mostly though, we have a lot of fun.<p>We_#x27;re giving a few developers the opportunity to rethink their life priorities and get out of Dodge for a while. You_#x27;re startup is flagging? Sick of the fog? Commute got you down? Just broke up with your partner? Why not pull the rip cord and come work with us for a while?<p>What do we have to offer?
* A vibrant, biggish (pop. 4M), student-oriented city, that_#x27;s full of hip bars, restaurants, and (really) beautiful, friendly people.
* A work environment that is, hands down, the hippest place to work in Mexico. Imagine programming in the hammock - poolside (yes, we have a pool).
* Use of the beach house. We have a 3 story beach house with all mod cons, 20 feet from a graceful, immaculate sandy bay in a small fishing village. Also, one of the premier left point surf breaks is 5 minutes away by boat (which we also have).
* A chance to learn (or practice your Spanish).
* An opportunity to be at ground zero for one of the most vibrant and rapidly expanding startup scenes in the world.
* Beef up your resume with experience in navigating the business climate in Mexico and Latin America.
* and, finally, ALMOST NO MONEY. Okay, not entirely true - you_#x27;ll be paid a very tidy wage (by mexican standards) which will allow you to live well here - most things are cheap here. However, if you compare what you_#x27;ll make here versus what you_#x27;re making now? It will be a disappointing exercise. Said differently, if money is what you_#x27;re after - then this is not for you. If you_#x27;re looking for adventure, fun, and to challenge your self with something new - welcome to your new home!!!<p>Who are we looking for? It_#x27;s all listed on the website: <a href="http://www.agavelab.com/hiring/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.agavelab.com_#x2F;hiring_#x2F;</a> but in summary:
HTML_#x2F;CSS_#x2F;Javascript kung fu
Mobile dev skills (android or iOS)
Server dev skills
Community managers_#x2F;growth hacking<p>Our technology stack is HTML5, CSS3, Java, NodeJS, MongoDB, Play Framework, Scala. But don_#x27;t worry if you don_#x27;t know these. As long as you have a very solid command of at least one programming language (Java, C, C++, Python, etc) and are smart as a whip, we can teach you the rest. We expect the same things that any software development shop would: ability to write clean, well-documented code, familiarity with Dev Environments (Xcode, CodeIgniter_#x2F;Play_#x2F;Angular_#x2F;etc.), experience with Agile_#x2F;Scrum concepts, etc. Culturally we look for self-starters that can thrive with very little guidance and who have a genuine passion of solving complex problems. You should also like beer (or not be afraid to watch others consume large quantities of it), music, the sun, and tacos.) Oh yes, and a sense of humor - you_#x27;ll want to bring that too.
You want to know more? Of course you do. Check out the site: www.agavelab.com or drop us an email. Maybe download_#x2F;visit a few of our apps and check them out. Or read some of our press:

Full-time and internship.<p>The Go Circuit (<a href="http://gocircuit.org" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;gocircuit.org</a>) is hiring Systems Engineers.<p>Original job posting: <a href="http://blog.gocircuit.org/job-system-engineer" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;blog.gocircuit.org_#x2F;job-system-engineer</a><p>PROJECT<p>The Go Circuit is a development, distribution and execution environment for a new generation of self-sustained distributed applications. The circuit is built almost entirely in the Go language with occasional appearances of C and C++. It spans the entire lifecycle of an application, from development to execution and sustanance. It comprises technologies like compilers, interpreters, optimizers, low-level operating system management, distributed resource sharing, information flow, security, and many others. The Go Circuit is, by design, open source.<p>The goal of the circuit is to enable the possibility of encoding an entire Internet company_#x27;s infrastructure in a single executable, which can be revived with a single click on an ice-cold cluster of empty hardware and can sustain itself indefinitely, without human involvement, short of the requisite replacement of hardware now and again.<p>The demonstrated, over the past year, power of the circuit environment has compelled industry, academic and government institutions to sponsor the project and become involved with large-scale deployments. We are, henceforth, expanding.<p>RESPONSIBILITIES<p>Full-time and internship candidates have identical responsibilities.<p>Systems Engineers will work alongside the founding system architect on all aspects of the technology: design, implementation, testing, fixing bugs, writing integration drivers, documentation and research. All of their work will be open-sourced. Almost all code will be written in Go, however, other languages like Python, C, C++, Lua, JavaScript, etc. will make a presence.<p>System Engineers will be researchers as well. In designing the semantic and linguistic interfaces of the circuit, we investigate past and present, scientific and industrial, literature and software on a wide range of algorithmic topics to help us inform and verify our choices.<p>QUALIFICATIONS<p>The ideal candidate, full-time and internship, would meet the following criteria, or demonstrate an equivalent level of technical sophistication:<p>* Full-time candidates should have B.A._#x2F;B.Sc., M.A._#x2F;M.Sc. or Ph.D. in some hard science. Internship candidates, who are near the completion of their studies towards the mentioned degrees, are also elligible.<p>* Four or more years of experience with a low-level_#x2F;systems programming language like C, C++, or Java as well as some experience in building systems, small or big alike, is quite desirable. Altenratively, a serious involvement with a more exotic concurrent or research language, like Haskell or Erlang, would work as well.<p>* Having a non-trivial open-source project (in any language) would be highly valued.<p>* Some understanding of how UNIX operating kernels and systems work on the inside. (You don_#x27;t need to be a specialist.)<p>* Knowledge of current industrial open-source technologies is good albeit not a deal-breaker. However, interest and desire to learn and hack some of them will be needed.<p>* Ability to read academic publications in Computer Science<p>Most importantly, we are looking for individuals who are able and willing to learn fast and have open flexible minds. On that note, we do not expect that you have prior Go experience, however we do expect that<p>* Candidates will come prepared to carry out the interview in Go.<p>We are not going to test your Go-intricacies skills. We simply expect that you be able to implement your solutions to our programming riddles in Go.<p>COMPENSATION<p>Compensation will vary based on experience as we welcome both out-of-college engineers and seasoned industry scientists. That said, compensation and benefits will be on par with the standard amongst institutions like Google, IBM, Microsoft and such.
Location<p>To apply, please, send your vitae and anything else you want to say to Petar at p@gocircuit.org.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6655327" href="vote?for=6655327_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%36%35%33%34%33%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6655327"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=frederickcook">frederickcook</a> 263 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6655327">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Square — NYC <a href="https://squareup.com/" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;squareup.com_#x2F;</a> ---<p>Square! In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80_#x2F;20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.<p>As a company, we have four main focuses.<p>Go international. We_#x27;re adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D_amp;B numbers and such.<p>Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were _quot;non-consumers_quot; to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven_#x27;t been eating someone else_#x27;s lunch, we_#x27;ve created a whole new category! Now it_#x27;s time to move up to bigger merchants.<p>The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (<a href="http://squareup.com/market" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;squareup.com_#x2F;market</a>) and Square Cash (<a href="http://squareup.com/cash" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;squareup.com_#x2F;cash</a>), we_#x27;re going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We_#x27;re at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.<p>Data as product. We_#x27;re leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.<p>In NYC, we_#x27;re starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We_#x27;re a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.<p>If you_#x27;re interested; I_#x27;d love to chat.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Oakland, CA - Director of Engineering at Geospatial Startup<p>Vehicle Data Science Corporation is looking for a Director of Engineering to lead design and implementation of software that processes and analyzes big spatial data sets. The company is an early-stage startup located in Oakland’s Rockridge neighborhood with initial funding from a National Science Foundation grant and a major automobile client. We use location data from vehicles to derive driving behaviors which we capture in a proprietary database. This database feeds applications in the areas of driver safety, fuel economy and autonomous vehicles.<p>We are looking for a smart, adaptable individual with plenty of skills and breadth in computing to build products from our data streams. By joining us today, you get a unique chance to engineer new technology from the ground up. Working in tandem with the company’s CTO, you will tackle both back end infrastructure and a web front end. Initially, the position will primarily involve hands-on coding and systems administration, but it can evolve toward more supervision and_#x2F;or architectural work as we grow, based on your inclinations.<p>Our current systems are built 100% in Python, with a PostGIS database in the back end. Our roadmap includes two key tasks that the Director of Engineering must be equipped to lead:
* Take the back end to the next level by splitting it into multiple databases that each fulfill a specific purpose, and shard our primary data warehouse so it can handle tens of terabytes. The choice of technologies is still to be determined, so a broad range of experience with distributed systems and nosql databases is desirable;
* Build an interactive web front end that dynamically displays geospatial data, in the form of both maps and charts. We are looking for a track record delivering interactive web applications, experience with web maps, and good programming skills both server-side and client-side.<p>Individuals who are creative, honest, open-minded, enterprising, kind and attentionate to details will fit our team the best. The project is incredibly fun and innovative, addresses major societal challenges in the areas of public health and sustainable development, and eyes a huge market opportunity. Come help us grow the company you want to be a part of!<p>To reach us, e-mail: contact@VDS-corp.com</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6654520" href="vote?for=6654520_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%36%35%33%34%33%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6654520"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=hyfen">hyfen</a> 263 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6654520">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Maker Studios - Los Angeles, CA - Full-Stack Web Engineer - All Levels<p>Join the team at Maker Studios, a next-generation digital video studio_#x2F;network. _quot;Maker_quot; has rolled-up a set of the largest and most influential YouTube channels and talent into a new network model.  The Company currently represents 50,000+ channels, and delivers 1.5 billion video views per month. Maker has an established reputation for guiding content creators in maximizing views and courting brands. Additionally, the Technology group within Maker innovates with world-class web engineering and design practices to produce high-quality apps and tools that connect content with eyeballs and usher content creators to new levels of mastery.<p>What does Maker build? We develop talent-facing web applications at high scale that connect YouTube content creators with each other, with our channel-management pros, and with tech such as ad optimization and alternative distribution targets. We also build internal web apps, APIs, and a handful of public-facing video_#x2F;content sites for our top talent. Here are some of the technologies we use:<p><pre><code>  - Backend: Node_#x2F;Express, Python_#x2F;Django,, Ruby_#x2F;Rails, NginX
  - Frontend: CoffeeScript, Jade_#x2F;Less_#x2F;Sass_#x2F;Stylus, Ember_#x2F;Angular_#x2F;Knockout, D3, WebGL
  - Testing: CircleCI, Cucumber, Mocha
  - Deployment: Capistrano, Fabric, Dotcloud, AWS, CloudFlare
  - Virtual Machines: Vagrant, Docker
  - SQL: Mysql, RedShift _#x2F; Postgres
  - NoSQL: Redis, Memcache, MongoDB, Neo4j, Hive_#x2F;Hadoop, Cassandra_#x2F;Riak
  - Linux: Bash_#x2F;Shell scripting
</code></pre>
Want more reasons to work at Maker? The engineering environment is exceptional. Maker_#x27;s CTO is a computer scientist himself who still codes regularly, and we have a very programmer-friendly workplace:<p><pre><code>  - You decide the technology.  The engineer who_#x27;s writing the code has
    the final vote on which technologies get used. We use APIs to cross-
    connect our projects with ease, which also enables us to use
    different languages in different projects.
  - Flexible work hours.  Come in as early or late as you want, as long
    as your total hours are on par with your peers; what really matters
    is the quality and quantity of your code commits.
  - Code intelligently.  We hack, but we also care about sharing code
    with each other, so we talk about readability and complexity, we
    develop all modules as though they_#x27;ll one day be open-sourced, and
    we believe in small tools used cleverly, at scale.
  - Open Source friendly.  Besides using mostly open-source tools, we_#x27;ve
    open-sourced several internally developed tools on
    https:_#x2F;_#x2F;github.com_#x2F;MakerStudios_#x2F;, and more are coming.
  - Great benefits.  We have amazing investors and we want healthy,
    enthusiastic employees, so we offer our engineers a highly
    competitive salary, top-notch health_#x2F;dental_#x2F;vision coverage,
    401(k), and stock options.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Academia.edu (San Francisco, CA) - Software Engineers, Designers, Data Scientists<p>At Academia.edu, we_#x27;re trying to accelerate the scientific process by changing the way scientific research is shared. Right now publication is slow, un-innovative, and expensive - we want it to be fast, innovative, and free. We_#x27;re a platform where scientists upload and share their research directly, and track metrics on the impact of their work. These metrics help when they apply for jobs and grants.<p>A leading climate scientist in Germany told us _quot;Academia.edu shows the impact of your work that is not covered by Web of Science and citation indexes of that sort. With Web of Science you only learn how many people have quoted what. But with Academia.edu I can see what is viewed, what is actually read or not. Here I learn something additional, something I would not know otherwise.”<p>5.1 million academics have signed up to Academia.edu, and around 1 million join every 2 months.<p>We are a 10 person team based in downtown San Francisco. We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures. We are looking for full-stack engineers, designers and data scientists. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, CoffeeScript, Backbone, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish.<p>Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes _quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world._quot;<p>There are some core values that define the Academia.edu culture. Since everyone in Academia.edu is involved in running the company, we look for these values in everyone we hire:<p>* Being a do-er - _quot;The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena_quot; - Theodore Roosevelt<p>* Being driven - _quot;Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end. It_#x27;s not a day when you lounge around doing nothing; it_#x27;s when you_#x27;ve had everything to do, and you_#x27;ve done it._quot; - Lord Acton<p>* Having equanimity - _quot;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win._quot; - Gandhi<p>* Having humility - knowing what you know, what you don_#x27;t know, and where you just have an instinct<p>* Being motivated to open up and accelerate science<p>See the founder, Richard Price, on Bloomberg TV: <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/academia-edu-scientific-research-available-to-all-14Q_Hj66RZqcSRlZ25spvw.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.bloomberg.com_#x2F;video_#x2F;academia-edu-scientific-resea...</a>

Our customers include some of the most well-known brands in the world and many, many digital agencies.<p>We’ve just scratched the surface of the things we can do to help our customers, and we think we can grow at a much faster rate if we keep delivering on our roadmap. We need your help getting there.<p>WHAT WE’RE LOOKING FOR: We’re looking for mid to senior level  software engineers, but we’re much less concerned about the specific level of experience than we are in finding people with the right attitude, ability to learn, and approach to solving problems.  Part of our team works remotely, and we’re open to remote work for this position for the right person.<p>Our app is written in Java, deployed on Amazon’s cloud and utilizes several open source dependencies.  Expert knowledge of Java and Linux are required. Experience with AWS and modern javascript technologies is a plus.<p>BuzzStream may be a good fit for you if...<p>* You want to work at a place where virtually everything you work on impacts the business and you know exactly how everything you build helps the customer.<p>* You don’t want to be pigeon-holed as “the guy_#x2F;girl who works on the [XYZ] part of the product.” You’ll be working on every part of the product and you’ll constantly be learning.<p>* It’s really important to you to work on a team where every person cares deeply about building great software that solves real problems.  You have no use for bureaucracy, pointless meetings, or team members that provide limited value but succeed as a result of fake hustle and strong political skills.<p>* You really want to learn what it takes to build a startup, but you’d rather not learn through the “I learned what not to do” method. We’ve made plenty of mistakes, but we’re past the stage of trying to figure out how to build a successful business.<p>If this sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to hear from you. Please send me a resume, along with a note telling me a bit about yourself and why you’re interested in BuzzStream.

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don_#x27;t artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I_#x27;ve worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and _gt; 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We_#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health_#x2F;vision_#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
    Just look here: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;beeradvocate.com_#x2F;beerfly_#x2F;city_#x2F;43

  - If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.

One of the features that make our system unique is that no one, including operators, customers, and ourselves, ever has access to the sensitive raw data. This property holds true even after we update the software running on the machines processing the sensitive data!<p>You should:<p><pre><code>    - be intelligent
    - have a good sense of humour
    - be an amazing programmer
    - wish to change the world
</code></pre>
Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.<p>The founding team consists of recent University of Cambridge graduates and a director at the Max-Planck Institute. In the past months we have also been joined by two excellent engineers.
The work environment is highly international and diverse, and we would like to keep it that way.<p>We are looking to hire one additional engineer, and are in the lucky position where we can afford to be picky with whom we choose. 
Our team is distributed, and we would therefore expect you to work remotely as well. We would prefer if you were located within one or two timezones of our own (UTC+2). We offer good and stable salary, generous equity, exciting problems to solve, and a fabulous team, and in turn expect you to be driven, social, and good at solving problems.<p>We hope to hear from you. Please email us at jobs@aircloak.com if you have any questions!<p>You can find more on our website: <a href="http://www.aircloak.com/join.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.aircloak.com_#x2F;join.html</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6655284" href="vote?for=6655284_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%36%35%33%34%33%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6655284"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=hemantv">hemantv</a> 263 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6655284">link</a></span></div><br>

Partners include Hulu.<p>DramaFever_#x27;s engineering team is currently seeking Full Stack and Back-end Developers (Python, Go, Django, Redis, AWS), Linux sysadmins, Devops pros, and Android developers.<p>Technology decisions are made for the right reasons at DramaFever, recognizing that sometimes right includes _quot;what would be most interesting_quot; -- our image processors and some analytics pieces are now Go.  We_#x27;ve got a mandate to be _quot;available everywhere_quot;, which means we_#x27;re on or soon to be on every major mobile OS and every home theater platform.<p>The backend stack is ever evolving with new services and tools being added all the time.  We use a 3rd party service when it_#x27;s cost efficient and sufficiently flexible and build stand-alone in house services when that makes the most sense.  Our level of automation is quite high with chef+vagrant and per-dev micro-instances for development, Jenkins built docker containers for deployments, and autoscaling in place for all production services.<p>Our development practices are always being refined -- last week we eliminated timesheets. We spec in google docs, keep code and issues in Github, and review (all) code in pull requests.  IRC is for engineering battlestations or deciding from where we_#x27;ll order lunch.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and want to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and_#x2F;or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Visit <a href="http://amacapital.net/careers.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;amacapital.net_#x2F;careers.html</a> to learn more, and send applications_#x2F;inquiries to careers@amacapital.net.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6654002" href="vote?for=6654002_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%36%35%33%34%33%37"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6654002"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=davidddavidson">davidddavidson</a> 263 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6654002">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Statwing - San Francisco (Mission District)<p>We love analyzing data. We love the feeling of getting an idea, exploring some hypotheses, and finding a surprising story in the data. And we love enabling others to have that feeling. So we’re creating the modern data analysis tool, so anyone can get as much value out of their data as a trained expert, and experts can get their insight much faster.<p>Most statistical analyses are conceptually simple, but existing software requires an unnecessarily large amount of statistical knowledge to ask simple questions. And even experts find these tools time-consuming and painful to use. So most people fall back to the much less powerful Excel (and its PivotTables), spending their time shuffling data around an interface that’s barely changed in 15 years. Statwing democratizes data analysis by making statistics easier to use and interpret than even Excel.<p>Our investors include Y Combinator, Jeff Hammerbacher (cofounded Cloudera, coined the term _quot;Data Science_quot;, built the Facebook data team) and Jason Seats (cofounded Slicehost, runs TechStars Cloud).<p>We_#x27;re hiring.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">AppDynamics -- San Francisco, CA -- H1B welcome<p>AppDynamics is a successful, well-funded startup in Application Performance Management space. Our product and business model are proving to be quite disruptive in a very large market. Companies like Netflix, Priceline.com, Deutsche Bank, Williams Sonoma, Betfair and Expedia are using AppDynamics to ensure the performance and availability of their revenue-critical applications.<p>AppDynamics_#x27; traditional products for JVM, CLR, PHP and Node.js kick ass at measuring server-side performance across your app. But with the shift to highly interactive websites and mobile apps, an increasing number of performance problems are caused by client-side code or internet latency. End-User Monitoring measures the performance that your real users_#x27; experience by instrumenting client-side platform APIs. EUM complements server-side monitoring, but comes with its own set of challenges:<p>* Client-side platforms are not designed for easy instrumentation. How can we extract meaningful performance data from web browsers, iOS, and Android?<p>* Client-side performance performance is confounded by the huge variability in devices, workloads, and network latency. How can we make sense of this complex, noisy, multi-dimensional data?<p>* How can we cope with the volume of performance data flooding in from millions_#x2F;billions of users?<p>* How can we incorporate client-side and server-side data into a complete picture of app performance?<p>Here are the components of our system, and what it takes to work on them:<p>Browser Agent:<p>* Write fast, bulletproof instrumentation for JavaScript that can run inside any web app across hundreds of browser versions.<p>* Understand behavioral and performance idiosyncrasies of various browsers.<p>* Incorporate new timing specifications from W3C performance working group, but develop fallback timing techniques for other browsers.<p>Mobile Agents:<p>* Build fast, bulletproof instrumentation for iOS (Objective-C) and Android (Java) platform APIs that can run inside any app across thousands of devices.<p>* Understand mobile app architecture and frameworks, identify strategies to extract user actions, performance and system crash data.<p>* Understand iOS, Android, and Dalvik internals, and the characteristics and constraints of mobile platforms in general.<p>Cloud:<p>* This is the processing platform that receives data from the agents. It_#x27;s a scalable data processor and analytics engine (think real-time map_#x2F;reduce) built on Amazon Web Services.<p>* Process billions of end-user requests from some of the biggest sites in the world.<p>* Scale with AWS infrastructure components (EC2, S3, DynamoDB, EMR, etc).<p>* Ensure zero downtime, zero data loss, continuous deployment, multi tenant, multi 
version, etc.<p>* Analyze huge volumes of data with statistical techniques, machine learning, predictive analysis.<p>UI:<p>* Design and build learnable, usable, data-rich HTML5 UI that helps users discover, triage, and root-cause performance problems.<p>* We use AngularJS and TypeScript.<p>I work in the EUM team and we are looking to expand.

email: jobs@refresh.io<p>Must be local or willing to relocate (paid)<p>A tagline of what we do is: Refresh helps connect people at a deeper level by providing realtime insights about them just as you_#x27;re about to meet them.<p>The best description however is found by simply installing the app (Iphone only at the moment - we_#x27;re in the app store, Android soon - see job description below!) and trying it yourself.<p>We_#x27;re super proud of the team we_#x27;ve built and we plan to keep the caliber high.<p>We have exactly one requirement for hiring an engineer - it_#x27;s someone we_#x27;d like to work with. That_#x27;s a simple statement, but if you dig deeper, there_#x27;s a lot to it. It says that we think they_#x27;re smart. And that we could learn from them. And that they could learn from us. And that we get along, and they fit our culture. And they_#x27;re passionate about our product like we are. And of course - that they also want to work with us.<p>Our interviews are fun - at least we think so. They_#x27;re largely modeled after largely after Google interviews (there_#x27;s a lot of Google interviewing experience in our team). Questions are either real problems we_#x27;ve had to solve (probably recently) or some abstractification of a bigger problem to see how you attack problems in general (with the _quot;getting the right answer_quot; not being the interesting part of the interview).<p>Specifically - We_#x27;re looking for:<p>Backend Developers:<p>You_#x27;re a crackshot in your backend language of choice. As I said, we_#x27;re building a system that does an incredible amount of work all while the user is waiting for it to complete - so needless to say, we_#x27;re looking for people who care about performance. A lot.<p>Our backend is a highly concurrent system written in Java using MongoDB. You might know Java or you might not, but either way you_#x27;re willing to learn. If you don_#x27;t know it - you can impress us in your language of choice. You understand algorithms matter. You also understand sloppy database access could make that ugly n^2 algorithm look absolutely blazing fast.<p>You love to code. You love to show off your results now and then to other engineers (as they_#x27;re probably the only folks around who might get the intracacies of what you_#x27;re excited about)<p>We_#x27;re looking for both Senior and Junior backend engineers. If you_#x27;re a Senior Engineer - you_#x27;ve worked in server-side code for a few years. You_#x27;ve scaled to thousands or millions of users.  You can talk to other Senior engineers with very few words because you both know the special cases, assumptions, and pitfalls cold.<p>If you_#x27;re a Junior engineer, you love to code and you_#x27;re good at it. But most importantly - Be smart. Be passionate. Be excited.  (New grads please apply!)<p>Android and IOS engineers:<p>You have apps in the store you can show us. You care about the user experience.  You have a few years under your belt in either Objective-C or Android-Java.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6653925" href="vote?for=6653925_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4a%6c%79%61%44%61%6a%5a%41%6d%4a%49%45%44%35%62%30%34%75%34%75%74"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6653925"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=spicyj">spicyj</a> 263 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6653925">link</a></span></div><br>

Since being founded in 2009 by recent Cambridge and UCL graduates who noticed a gap in the market when making their own leavers_#x27; yearbook, we have had considerable success: over the past two years our sales have grown more than tenfold and we are now the market leader in the UK. After a particularly successful academic year in 2012-2013, we’re expanding our development team and are now looking for an ambitious Junior _#x2F; Graduate Developer to help us to continue to grow.<p>Your job will involve working on many different aspects of our software and technology systems. We’ve managed to automate a highly complex design process, allowing us to create customised book layouts at the push of a button. This has involved bringing together many of the latest and most exciting software technologies and combining them in new ways to build a genuinely innovative piece of engineering. While we won’t expect you to understand it all straight away, you’ll be given the freedom to work on whichever parts of the system most interest you, and will be supported by the rest of the development team in learning the best practices of modern software engineering. This will include opportunities to get involved with: front-end development using the latest OOP JavaScript frameworks, back-end development, DevOps and automated server provisioning using Chef and Vagrant, automated testing, continuous integration and automated layout design.<p>Working at Yearbook Machine is not the corporate grind: we’re a small group of like-minded, focused individuals working to create a product we genuinely believe in. We work hard but our environment is relaxed and friendly. Our office is based in a light and airy converted warehouse in central Shoreditch, which we share with another design startup. We_#x27;re currently a team of just 6 people, 5 of whom are developers.<p>Requirements<p><pre><code>  - 2:1 above in Computer Science or other similarly technical degree subject
  - Experience with OOP and at least some knowledge of modern software development paradigms such as MVC
  - A genuine passion for technology: we’ll be interested to see what you’ve been doing in your spare time!
</code></pre>
Benefits<p><pre><code>  - Highly competitive, above-market salary
  - Generous stock options
  - The best equipment: Your choice of computer and monitor(s) and a comfortable chair
  - Job satisfaction: we make a product that is fun to build and that our customers love!

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">LightSide - Pittsburgh - Full-Time Frontend Developer<p>We_#x27;re hiring an experienced web developer for a full-time position building rich frontend applications, powered by our machine learning backend. The platform will aim to help teachers assess student work, such as essays or journals, and improve student writing through feedback during the revision and editing process.<p>Our web services are built in Python using the Django framework, and our backend is powered by state-of-the-art machine learning implemented in Java. Our team has a strong technical background and a history of work in education. In this position, you’ll be implementing a rich web application using client-side frontend frameworks. Your role will be to bridge the gap between our RESTful API for writing assessment and our wireframed user workflows for student and teacher access to these tools.<p>This job will be highly collaborative in an early-stage, self-funded and profitable startup. Your primary responsibilities will focus on frontend development, but you’ll occasionally dive into our Python web services and collaborate on defining our user workflows including UX and visual design. Dependent on interest and experience, you may be asked to contribute to the Java machine learning software that powers our platform.<p>No experience with machine learning or natural language processing is necessary or expected, but you need to be eager and interested in finding out how those tools work and how they can help students and teachers. You’ll be working under the guidance of experienced researchers from Carnegie Mellon’s Language Technologies Institute and Human-Computer Interaction Institute.<p>We prefer an on-site employee at our office in Pittsburgh, PA, but may make exceptions for an outstanding candidate. Compensation will be competitive and based on experience.<p>Skills and Requirements<p>Ideal candidates will have an active interest in educational technology, are interested in using machine learning for real-world benefit, and have prior experience including the following:<p>* Rich web application development using JavaScript frameworks like Angular, Ember, or Backbone.<p>* Web layout and implementation of frontend page design using HTML and CSS.<p>* Designing and working with RESTful APIs providing complex functionality to frontend applications.<p>* Agile development on a small, dynamic team.<p>You might also bring other wonderful things to the table, such as:<p>* Experience with deployment and continuous integration on Amazon Web Services or another cloud host.<p>* Live support and operations management for large-scale customer-facing web services.<p>* Development experience for web MVC frameworks, especially using Python with Django.<p>* A background in educational technology or enthusiasm about helping people improve their writing.<p>* Prior real-world experience with machine learning applications.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6654500" href="vote?for=6654500_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4a%6c%79%61%44%61%6a%5a%41%6d%4a%49%45%44%35%62%30%34%75%34%75%74"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6654500"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sparkman55">sparkman55</a> 263 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6654500">link</a></span></div><br>

Rinse is a very early-stage startup (we are only 3 people currently) looking to bring technology to the dry-cleaning industry. The industry is ripe for innovation! We_#x27;re building mobile apps, tackling scheduling and dispatch problems, and scaling a service at over 10% week-on-week growth for months now.<p>I know _#x27;app for laundry_#x27; is a tech cliché right now, but we_#x27;re definitely encountering real demand. The problem is real, and we_#x27;re solving it.<p>The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading operations, and a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition. I_#x27;m Stanford CS_#x2F;EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business.
The tech stack is Heroku _#x2F; Python _#x2F; Django _#x2F; Celery _#x2F; Phonegap _#x2F; JQuery _#x2F; Backbone _#x2F; Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well. We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.<p>We_#x27;re looking for a Web Developer or Front-end Developer to develop interfaces for our customers, tools for our personnel, and visualizations for our managements. Ideally, this person would also have an active role in the design process as well, either leading design or working with our contract designer.<p>We_#x27;re also looking for a Director of Marketing.  Rinse is a quintessential B2C business, with plenty of opportunities for online advertising, offline collateral, partnerships, and _#x27;growth hacking._#x27;  We_#x27;re building a scalable business model and the technology to support it, now help us scale the business.  Please see a job description at <a href="http://bit.ly/1dLJigo" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;bit.ly_#x2F;1dLJigo</a> - The sky_#x27;s the limit!<p>Finally, if anyone in San Francisco is looking to make a few extra dollars part-time, Rinse is hiring part-time Associates to help us deliver clothes. We pay $25 per hour for a handful of hours per week. Perhaps it would be a way for some of you bootstrapping startups to earn a little extra cash?

Results from a recent pilot program show that the platform can produce an average energy savings of 20% with up to 50% in savings for top performers.<p>See our open positions at <a href="http://utilities.simpleenergy.com/about-us/jobs" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;utilities.simpleenergy.com_#x2F;about-us_#x2F;jobs</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6654119" href="vote?for=6654119_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4a%6c%79%61%44%61%6a%5a%41%6d%4a%49%45%44%35%62%30%34%75%34%75%74"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6654119"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=navneetloiwal">navneetloiwal</a> 263 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6654119">link</a></span></div><br>

The test won the Wall Street Journal Innovation Award for Medicine, was named one of Scientific American_#x27;s _quot;Top 10 World Changing Ideas,_quot; and was featured in the New York Times. Our test is now prescribed by physicians for more than 12% of all carrier screens in the United States.<p>The cost of sequencing human genomes is plunging - over 5x faster than the cost of computing; the potential impact on preventive healthcare and the medical landscape is boundless.

We are building the technology platform to make genomics useful and accessible to everyone.<p>TechCrunch article:  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/23/counsyl" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;techcrunch.com_#x2F;2013_#x2F;04_#x2F;23_#x2F;counsyl</a><p>The vast majority of our operations are powered by our own custom-built infrastructure on a Python_#x2F;Django_#x2F;Postgres stack, from ordering to lab processing to billing.

Before ShowKit, it would take companies and software engineers months of intensive development to add features like audio_#x2F;video conferencing, screen sharing, and gesture control to their applications. Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users_#x27; screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio_#x2F;video conference.<p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding _amp; decoding.

What would University look like if we scrapped our current model and started over? We think it will blend incredibly high-quality offline teaching and mentoring from real teachers (think the best charter schools in the country), not professors, with free but super high-quality flipped-classroom online learning (think EdX, Coursera), and a new model of apprenticeship so students leave school ready for anything. We’re launching in Kenya early next year and aim to quickly expand across Africa.<p>We’re looking for a versatile team member who can lead everything from our high-level technology strategy (When do we invest in building our own platform? Do our students use tablets or laptops?) to the nuts and bolts of our hardware decisions, front-end development and basic back-end (e.g., Rails + HTML_#x2F;CSS + very basic devops on top of Heroku or AWS). This hire will be the founding member of our technology team.<p>Our dream hire is creative and resourceful but also ambitious – we’d love this person to grow with us into a VP or CTO-type role over the next few years.<p>About us:<p>- We’re taking on what we think is one of the biggest problems in the world
- We’re a social enterprise and are funded so far with $1M+ in non-dilutive seed grants with another $1M on the way
- Our non-profit sister organization kepler.org, where we’re also part of the founding team, got more than 2,500 applications for our first 50 spots and has been written up in Scientific American, Fast Company, and The Chronicle of Higher Education, who thinks our work will be a model for the US.
- We’re in Kenya but are open to discussing some remote work for the right candidate
- Competitive salary, generous equity awards depending on experience and awesome, inspiring teammates<p>About you:<p>- At least a couple years of experience building things, ideally front-end and back-end
- Agile generalist and resourceful problem solver
- Excited about a tech role that goes beyond getting people to click on ads<p>Anything you_#x27;ve built or designed (Github profile, personal web apps, design portfolio, etc) that you can include in your application much appreciated!</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6653613" href="vote?for=6653613_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4a%6c%79%61%44%61%6a%5a%41%6d%4a%49%45%44%35%62%30%34%75%34%75%74"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6653613"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=cmolzen">cmolzen</a> 263 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6653613">link</a></span></div><br>

Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world_#x27;s first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping.<p>Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it_#x27;s hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry.<p>We are changing that.

Bridging the gap between real estate professionals and their clients. Real estate is the largest industry in the world. It’s also one of the most important—after all, everyone needs a place to live. Millions of consumers are looking for their next home online, and they expect the same kind of browsing and buying experience they get on sites like Amazon and Facebook. Unfortunately, real estate agents are struggling to provide that experience. That’s where Placester comes in. We’re creating an industry where it_#x27;s quick and simple for real estate professionals to get their information on the web. Don’t let that simple description fool you. We’re addressing the hardest problem in the largest industry in the world. As you might have guessed, not everything is written on the home page yet.<p>Our Culture: Team. Join the team that makes a difference in a big, complex industry. Our culture is all about teamwork. That being said, we_#x27;re composed of folks who are their own brand of brilliant, focused, fun, intense, and friendly. If you_#x27;ve ever worked on a high performing team you_#x27;ve experienced this mix before. You’ll be expected to get things done and be responsible for making it happen, without any bureaucratical mess. You’ll be expected to identify problems and solve them on your own. But more importantly, you may need to rally a friend or team to overcome them. Both are key tools on your belt. You’ll be expected to have an opinion because it will matter when shaping the outcome of your company.<p>Opinions are about courage: to speak your mind and to change it. Everyone laughs a lot over lunch. Topics range from the standard technical, tactical and whos-doing-what in the start up world; but they also weave through topics like the proper structure for the US debt, that great restaurant down the street or how to Sous-vide the perfect piece of meat. Brilliance isn’t one-dimensional.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6699167" href="vote?for=6699167_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4a%6c%79%61%44%61%6a%5a%41%6d%4a%49%45%44%35%62%30%34%75%34%75%74"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6699167"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jwarrenreed">jwarrenreed</a> 256 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6699167">link</a></span></div><br>

and motivated software engineers.  One immediate role would be perfect for 
someone who is great with numbers and analytics.  The other role is better suited
towards someone who loves working in the front-end and loves making things 
look and interact beautifully- with html, javascript, and css.  In both cases the 
engineers should love building cool things, learning, and social media.  We are 
in Portland, Maine which is atypical for Hacker News, but is a great place to live!  
We aren_#x27;t looking for remote workers at this time.<p>We are a tech-startup-spinoff of the award-winning (NYC-based) agency Likeable 
Media, and we are looking for people that are willing to jump right in and be on 
our small team (currently 3 other full-time developers) creating features that will 
be visible and impactful and used immediately.<p>We are hard-working and smart, and we love to solve challenging problems.  
We use a lot of node.js, javascript, python, django, and the Oxford comma.<p>You love being a substantial contributor and are interested in the “full stack” of 
technologies from details of server configuration, back-end, front-end, and mobile 
platforms.  You are self-disciplined, self-directed, but also detail-oriented in your 
communication about what choices you make and what you are doing.<p>Likeable Local offers an integrated software solution that allows small businesses 
to create, enhance and manage their social media presence. Likeable Local was 
founded in 2012 and has a deployed product that integrates with Facebook and 
Twitter. The software is sold on a subscription basis, allowing for attractive recurring 
revenue economics, and is in use by dentists, dry cleaners, florists, and jewelers 
and we continue to expand.<p>Interested?

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Ditto, did you consider Java to Javascript? It may make sense to you given that you are using AngularJS on the front-end as well as for consolidating skills.<p>I am a Ruby_#x2F;Rails dev that switched to using Clojure and Node.js, depending on the use cases. I wouldn_#x27;t want to use Ruby for anything else than static sites and tooling now.
Some people think that Javascript is a gimmick, but is it vastly superior to Ruby when it comes to concurrency, ability to share back-end and front-end code, and the tools have gotten really good too.<p>PS: I wouldn_#x27;t necessarily recommend switching from Java to Scala, the benefits may be low or negative for most people, see Yammer_#x27;s experience: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/11/yammer-scala" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.infoq.com_#x2F;news_#x2F;2011_#x2F;11_#x2F;yammer-scala</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6663769" href="vote?for=6663769_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%45%75%43%4f%6f%4f%34%69%77%32%71%6b%52%4c%72%55%74%4c%51%65%46%6c"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6663769"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tbrooks">tbrooks</a> 261 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6663769">link</a></span></div><br>

Inck teaches them a new approach to thinking and communication that incorporates rhythm into the process. Through the same interface, Inck also provides mechanisms for them to engage in Generative Programming to build one of a menu of useful programs. Students choose what to build based on their own requirements for a software agent to help make their PCs more productive. The first prototype of Inck will be released on Jan 14th, 2014 to students at a local high tech institute.<p>Inck is written in C for the (old) Windows platform. Your work, to start with, will mostly involve programming. Over time, as you internalize the product idea, you will become more involved with product definition and the productization process (higher level stuff).<p>We pay you a market rate salary and upon successful completion of a six month probation process, we give you 1% equity in the company. We work a 36 hour, six hours a day, six day work week. Our work environment is intense and challenges you to grow. Allahabad is a laid back town with an academic tilt. This position provides you an opportunity to learn a lot of good engineering while at the same time share in the success of a new company.

We_#x27;re looking for experienced software engineers who are up to that challenge to join our small team (currently 2 founders and 1 employee).<p>At Codified your responsibilities will be wide - you will probably end up touching every piece of software we write, with an emphasis on our user-facing applications.<p>We have a large number of interesting projects under active development, spanning natural language processing, machine learning, user interface design and sequence analysis.<p>Skills _amp; Requirements
We_#x27;re looking for software engineers. We are currently using GWT (Java) and MySQL with some scripting in Python and deploy to a Linux (CentOS) environment. We will need you to rapidly be productive with these tools if you are not familiar with them already. Additionally, you_#x27;ll help us grow our team over the next few months as we continue to add engineers.<p>A willingness to learn is more important to us than a Biology background, but the position will require you to become familiar with the Biology that underlies what we do.<p>About the company
We write software to help clinicians interpret exome sequence data from their patients. To do this, we aggregate large amounts of additional data on individual genes and variants, and apply a series of proprietary algorithms. We’re a young company (founded in March 2013) that is profitable with our existing customers and continuing to grow.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_6653927" href="vote?for=6653927_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%45%75%43%4f%6f%4f%34%69%77%32%71%6b%52%4c%72%55%74%4c%51%65%46%6c"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_6653927"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=squirrel">squirrel</a> 263 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6653927">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;re developing the solution our customers have been clamoring for.<p>Join our team of 5 people, and come make a big difference in an industry of dinosaurs.  Our existing customers are all very happy, and we have a ton more waiting for their rollout of the software.  We use Python_#x2F;Django_#x2F;Postgres on the backend and CoffeeScript with Backbone.Marionette on the frontend.
