<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Khan Academy — Mountain View, CA (we also love interns, and remote is a possibility)<p>We_#x27;re a small, non-profit tech startup trying to give a free, world-class education to anyone, anywhere. We_#x27;re making a big mobile push and need your help.<p>Here_#x27;s a testimonial we received recently:<p>==================================<p>Hi! My name is Chelsie and I_#x27;m a college student. When I was 19 years old I was kicked out of a great university because I had terrible grades. My disappointed parents cut me off financially so I began working night shifts to support myself. The truth is, I had no desire to go to school because learning had always seemed very distant from reality to me. ... Success in school felt like something you either had or you didn_#x27;t, and I had been getting Cs since middle school….I stumbled across [your] videos about math. I HATED math. I watched them anyway. I don_#x27;t know why, but I did. I loved them. I continued watching videos- chemistry, programming, physics. I_#x27;m 24 now, and I_#x27;m in college pursuing a degree in computer engineering. I have straight As. Sal_#x27;s videos made me feel like I had the capacity for understanding math and science even though my parents never sent me to space camp and I never won a ribbon at a science fair in elementary school...<p>==================================<p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who_#x27;re thankful for free, high-quality educational content.<p>Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal_#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>And now we_#x27;re doing a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets. We_#x27;re totally overhauling our iOS app.<p>If you join us now, you can be a core developer on an app that is guaranteed to have millions of users. We have loads of high-quality educational content just waiting to be shared within a great product. We have partnerships lined up around the block to promote your work. We just need you.<p>You_#x27;ll be part of a small team working alongside both _quot;celebrity_quot; devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google_#x27;s first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more of us normal folk ;) you haven_#x27;t heard of but who are workin_#x27; hard to help education.<p>Apply at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/careers" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.khanacademy.org_#x2F;careers</a> and be sure to mention that you_#x27;re coming from HN.

Patients and their oncologists use our analyses to help make decisions about how to treat their cancer. With us, you_#x27;d help build the systems that doctors and patients use to access and interpret our results, and work on the systems we use to manage our internal processes.<p>It_#x27;s really important that our users (patients and doctors) be able to understand the results we_#x27;re giving back to them. So we_#x27;re looking for someone who can translate our analyses into web pages that are clear, simple, and well-designed. That makes front-end experience and an eye for aesthetics important, but you_#x27;ll be working on the backend as well.<p>Our current web apps are built using:<p>* Scala, with the Play framework<p>* Python, with Django and Flask<p>* Javascript, with Angular.js and D3<p>* HTML_#x2F;CSS_#x2F;LESS with Bootstrap<p>* Postgres<p>It_#x27;s great if you_#x27;re familiar with those, but general web dev skill and the ability to pick up new tools and technologies is more important. Our other systems also use R, and we_#x27;re experimenting with the Julia language, so if you_#x27;re looking to work with interesting technology then you_#x27;ll find kindred spirits here.<p>CTIG is located in Mission Bay in San Francisco, across the street from the UCSF campus here. We_#x27;re a very interdisciplinary group, with bioinformaticians and computational biologists from UC Berkeley, UC Santa Cruz, and UCSF; biologists from UCSF, and physicians from Harvard Medical School. Some of us have PhDs, some of us have MDs, and some of us are college dropouts; we_#x27;re not credentialists, but we do have strong backgrounds in our respective fields. It_#x27;s a small team with 6 programmers, so you_#x27;d be a core contributor and you_#x27;d help set our technical direction.<p>We_#x27;re very serious about cancer, but pretty laid-back otherwise; office discussions range from the nitty-gritty details of molecular biology and machine learning to re-enactments of South Park episodes.<p>We_#x27;re looking for people who are authorized to work in the US, and can work full-time on-site in SF.

Rather than carry out wet-lab experiments by hand, researchers can code up (or visually configure) their experimental protocols and then run them in Transcriptic_#x27;s central, highly automated _#x27;biocenter_#x27; in an on-demand way. Customers have no upfront capital costs and pay for only what they use. Life science research today is incredibly slow, error-prone, monotonous, and expensive with researchers spending many hours a day every day just moving small volumes of liquids from one place to another. We_#x27;re building a long-term company to completely change the way life science research and development is done.<p>We_#x27;re looking for a highly talented full-stack web developer. On top of our robotic work cells is a slew of internal services as well as a Rails app that acts as our lab information management system and customer-facing UI. Challenges range from building rich, interactive interfaces for composing protocols to presenting analytical data generated by the lab back to the user.

We_#x27;re hiring for full time and summer intern positions as software developers and software designers.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don_#x27;t artificially limit ourselves.
    Recently, I_#x27;ve worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside PhoneGap),
    Angular.js, QT and of course Ruby.

  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and _gt; 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We_#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.

  - We offer competitive salaries, health_#x2F;vision_#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  - We run a makerspace in our building (http:_#x2F;_#x2F;grmakers.com), which gives us access
    to lots of cool machines.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.

  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
    Just look here: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;beeradvocate.com_#x2F;beerfly_#x2F;city_#x2F;43

  - If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.

  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love making software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.

  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.

  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.
</code></pre>
I_#x27;m a software craftsman on this awesome team.

We do all of this for two reasons: 1.) We want to build apps that customers love in the best way possible, and that often means taking the time to explore proper approaches.

We_#x27;re Waze for Cargo.

Really neat stuff.<p><pre><code>  ===========================

The Climate Corporation_#x27;s mission is to help all the world_#x27;s people and businesses manage and adapt to climate change. We use a combination of weather monitoring, agronomic modeling, and weather simulation to provide real-time pricing and purchasing of customizable weather insurance to farmers in the United States.<p>Climate_#x27;s technical staff numbers around 80, and we_#x27;re hiring full-time employees and interns across many teams as we expand efforts on a new class of decision support tools for growers. Work is split across groups focusing on web applications for farmers and agents, risk and insurance policy management, internal platform and data services, and scientific modeling and research, with roles for:<p>1. Software engineering generalists with solid CS fundamentals, particularly anyone interested in building (i) entirely new, large-scale distributed data services for scientific computing (we use Clojure); and (ii) web applications (Rails, Python, Javascript, and iOS) used by farmers to manage weather risk.<p>2. Quantitative researchers in statistics_#x2F;ML, stochastic optimization, remote sensing, atmospheric physics, and agronomics. Our goal is to forecast statistical distributions of crop yield for any piece of arable land, synthesizing satellite images, digital elevation models, weather data, agricultural statistics, and geological surveys into multiscale models that underly our data services.<p>3. Experienced technical team leads, operations engineers, product managers, and designers to pull all this together into a compelling product.<p>The scale and interdiscplinary nature of the work drive a lot of cross-collaboration within the company, supported by a pressing need to build durable solutions to some very important problems.<p>Competitive salary, excellent benefits, stock options, etc. Our 25% time is lumped into two-week sabbaticals. The usual details about these positions are here: <a href="https://hire.jobvite.com/j?bj=o7B8Wfww_amp;s=hackernews" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;hire.jobvite.com_#x2F;j?bj=o7B8Wfww_amp;s=hackernews</a><p>I write ruby for our application platform team.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) looking to add one or two engineers focusing on strategy and_#x2F;or on infrastructure. No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs covering everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Learn more at <a href="http://amacapital.net/careers.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;amacapital.net_#x2F;careers.html</a>, and contact us at careers@amacapital.net.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7325134" href="vote?for=7325134_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%33%32%34%32%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7325134"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=abuggia">abuggia</a> 143 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7325134">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do _quot;expense reports that don_#x27;t suck!_quot; (Google _quot;expensify_quot; to read more.) We_#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren_#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it_#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won_#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn_#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We_#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We_#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing_#x2F;designing_#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you_#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you_#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000"><p><pre><code>    Senior PHP Engineer
    We Are Base 
    Bournemouth, United Kingdom
    Full time, in house
</code></pre>
A bit about the role <p>This is a genuine opportunity to work alongside talented people to innovate and build digital services that make a difference to people every day, including an exciting product spin out. Working in an increasingly connected life, the role looks a little something like this:<p>1st class engineer <p>You will be used to working as part of an unsilo’d production team, where designers work alongside developers, in agile sprints where they’re useful. Your main skill set is writing PHP but you may have experience with other languages (like JavaScript_#x2F;Node.js, Go, Objective C or Java) that has influenced how you code. You’ll be familiar with PHP frameworks, such as Symfony, Laravel, Aura _amp; Zend, and building on top of content management systems, such as WordPress. You’ll be comfortable with object orientated design patterns, unit testing, APIs _amp; databases. Every pony at Base is capable of more than one trick. You’ll have an understanding of usability and how that works with functionality<p>Data hungry <p>You’ll have a keen interest in datasets, with good skills in filtering the signals from the noise. You’ll have an eye to the future and know that tracking something now will make for way more interesting times later. You’ll be comfortable integrating 3rd party systems through APIs you’ve helped architect.<p>Open all hours <p>You’ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you’ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you’ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.<p>Solver of riddles <p>You won’t know the answer to every question that comes your way, but you’ll be someone who knows how to hunt it down. This job isn’t forensic science, but being able to piece the jigsaw back together and crack the nut is your daily bread. Inquisitive by nature you, like us, want to understand what makes things tick to make them better.<p>Getting shit done <p>You’ll understand technical debt and be acutely aware that most pieces of code aren’t perfect, but you’ll be good at balancing the need to do something beautifully and the need to do it fast, including both where you can. You’ll regularly use Git, bash scripting and Sass, or similar, because of what they bring to the table.<p>Commercially aware <p>You will be able to develop a genuine understanding of our client businesses, allowing you to identify opportunities for and with them. The best developers understand the end goal, not just their role in a project. You’ll be able to think commercially about the client business, as well as deliver work that doesn’t fall over as its user base scales. You’ll be expected to apply innovation to solve challenges, remembering that the best solutions are often beautiful in their simplicity.<p>Keen eye, tuned ear <p>An eye for detail and a high standard of output is important to the success of the role. We’ve developed a code standard that gives us a bar to reach for. You’ll play a part in developing and guiding it as we grow. You’ll know that most project budgets don’t allow interface designers to cover every inch of an application, so you’re good at communicating with them and finding ways to smartly join the dots with a minimum of fuss.<p>Security and speed <p>You’ll be hot on security too. The one thing that no one sees, until it goes to the wall. Then everyone knows about it. You’ll know how to react when an overseas friend tries to gain access to one of your servers from your years of ethical hacking. Creating applications that are quick is fundamental to the role too. An understanding of devices, connections and optimisation is key to delivering the quality we’re after. But then you already know that.<p>About We Are Base<p>We_#x27;re a digital service design company that builds user-centred digital services for businesses, using data they already have.<p>We help our clients realise opportunities by transforming their data into something new and valuable. Clients include Timex, Garmin and Nottingham City Transport.<p>At Base you will be part of a team of makers and doers, working across a variety of projects and clients. We’re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.<p>We value and support CPD, actively seeking clients with a like-minded desire to push boundaries, providing you with an opportunity to build your experience and skills.<p>We practice a sustainable pace, recognising that we each have lives and families outside of work. Late nights and _gt; 40 hour weeks are rare by design.<p><a href="http://wearebase.com/hiring" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;wearebase.com_#x2F;hiring</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7325146" href="vote?for=7325146_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%33%32%34%32%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7325146"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pbiggar">pbiggar</a> 143 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7325146">link</a></span></div><br>

We have traction and revenue and funding and great customers. Our customers love us, because we move quickly, build great things, and provide amazing support. Everyone talks to customers a lot.<p>We_#x27;re still a small team, so you_#x27;ll have a large impact on company culture. We_#x27;re highly influenced by Valve_#x27;s Employee handbook and Stripe and GitHub_#x27;s cultures, and have as flat a structure as we can. We_#x27;re looking for frontend engineers (JS), designers (must be able to HTML+CSS), and backend engineers (Clojure). Being a mix of those is of course welcome! We lean towards senior experienced engineers, or junior engineers who can display great talent.<p>We_#x27;re also looking for engineers for Developer Success and Developer Awareness positions. Since we have an incredibly technical product, and selling directly to developers, the dev-awareness positions (think marketing, but much more dev-oriented: dev evangelism, writing interesting blogs, CRO, analytics, etc - think a patio11-style engineer) require significant development experience. Dev-success positions are a good fit for engineers who like working with people and building relationships with customers.<p>Check out our jobs page at <a href="https://circleci.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;circleci.com_#x2F;jobs</a>.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7325662" href="vote?for=7325662_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%33%32%34%32%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7325662"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zbruhnke">zbruhnke</a> 143 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7325662">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;re building a nation-wide coalition loyalty program and already have thousands of clients and thousands of locations on the program. Our clients include a half-dozen Fortune 50 companies - one that is an anchor partner in our coalition loyalty program. As the Director of Software Development I need some help! You will be joining a medium sized team of 11 developers. If you are interested in any of these positions my contact information is under my profile.<p>* Data Scientist<p>We are looking for a world-class data scientist to get in to the minds of our customers. Your job will be to analyze our _quot;large_quot; data-sets, identify patterns, determine consumer sentiment and provide them with incredible offer. Looking for someone with extensive programming and modeling experience using the Hadoop ecosystem. At KickBack you will research and implement new scalable learning algorithms and data mining techniques including sequential data models, variable discretization, feature extraction, selection, and construction. Machine learning a plus. We_#x27;re looking for an expert.  We are looking for someone someone we would consider a _quot;game changer_quot; and are paying accordingly.<p>* Mobile Developer<p>We_#x27;re looking for two mobile developers who insanely great at objective-c and_#x2F;or java development for Android. We have a specific vision for our mobile platform and have already moved past html5 interfaces to native applications to improve performance.  We_#x27;re doing things with iBeacons this year and innovating a few retail use-cases in our R_amp;D lab for our second version of our mobile app.  This is a really fun position where KickBack is small enough that specs and designs aren_#x27;t handed to you.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Hi! We’re Red Hot Labs from San Francisco and we_#x27;re looking for a FULL-TIME DEV and a FULL-TIME ADMIN_#x2F;GENERALIST.<p>We_#x27;re on a mission to revolutionize how mobile developers harness their data.  Our product, still in beta, functions as the central hub for all the services mobile developers already use.  By weaving together the data from these disparate services, we gain a comprehensive view of the app and are uniquely positioned to deliver insights and value back to the developer.<p>This isn_#x27;t our first trip around the block.  Our previous startup was acquired by Zynga and our core technology turned into FarmVille and the rest of Zynga’s most successful games.  It was a wild ride and now we’re full steam ahead on a new adventure. We_#x27;re well backed by folks such as A16Z, Greylock, SVAngel, DCVC, and more.<p>We_#x27;re looking for passionate, energetic, highly talented engineers to join our team.  By becoming a foundational member of our team you will help shape the direction of our product, company and culture.  We’re believe in constantly challenging ourselves to learn new things and would love to teach you what we know and learn from you as well.<p>We want all engineering members of the team to be full-stack engineers and well-rounded individuals.  But, we_#x27;re especially excited about the following engineering profiles:<p>==================================<p><pre><code>  - Senior Product Engineer: You_#x27;ve built products from  concept all the way to 
  maturity.  You_#x27;re as opinionated and influential about product as you are about coding.  
  You_#x27;re a master at JS_#x2F;CSS_#x2F;HTML and customer facing technologies. 
  Bonus points if you’re on-top of your front-end frameworks like Angular 
  (which we use!), Ember, or Meteor.

  - Senior Systems Engineer: You_#x27;ve architected and scaled backend systems to 
  millions of users.  You_#x27;ve put out every kind of fire and learned a lot in the 
  process. You understand the tradeoffs of different data stores, server 
  architectures, and low-level services. 

  - Senior Data Engineer: You_#x27;ve built models which extract insights or 
  predictions from large, living datasets.  You can engage with a dataset in an 
  unfamiliar domain, grasp the dynamics of the system and impress subject area 
  experts with your result.  

  - Stupendous Junior Engineer: You don_#x27;t have years of working experience, but 
  you have handful of mind-blowing personal or school projects.  You were among 
  the best students at a top tier engineering university. Your TA_#x27;s and 
  classmates gush about your code.

</code></pre>
OUR STACK:<p><pre><code>  - Redis, MySQL, Rails for our backend API.
  - Mostly AWS with a little bit of Heroku for our hosting.
  - AngularJS, jQuery, Underscore, Node.JS with D3 for our dashboard and web apps.
  - 3rd party services: Facebook, Mixpanel, Stripe, Mailgun
</code></pre>
==================================<p>In addition, we_#x27;re hiring for an admin_#x2F;generalist position. We_#x27;re looking for someone that doesn_#x27;t necessarily know how to code (if you_#x27;re interested in learning we can definitely help you there!), but is passionate about startups and is competent and considerate in any task thrown their way. This role would be to support the rest of the team to help with marketing, sales, general office admin stuff, scheduling interviews, QA, and so on. Basically, all of the _quot;other stuff_quot; in a startup.<p>Do any of the above profiles sound like you?

shared web pages every day, automatically classify them into tens of thousands
of topics, and serve up personalized feeds in real-time using our homegrown,
lightning fast, machine learning-based relevance engine.  We are looking to
grow our top-notch team, with both junior and senior-level positions available.<p>We are looking for engineers with deep interest and knowledge in at least one 
area core to our business (i.e., distributed systems, ops and tooling, machine
learning, designing and building new product features). We’re a small team, so
you will have the opportunity to have a lot of impact, and to learn from peers
who are extremely talented engineers, computer scientists, and data experts.
Our backend is written entirely in Clojure, a JVM-based LISP that is a dream to
work in. Almost none of us knew it before we joined, and we don’t expect you to
either. We do, however, expect the following:<p>- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess.
- You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs.
- You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful.
- You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two.
- You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are.
- You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.<p>Here’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:<p>- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive
- Building out new product features in our API 
- Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly
- Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more
- Creating tools to assist development and ops 
- Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7325616" href="vote?for=7325616_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%33%32%34%32%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7325616"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sbuccini">sbuccini</a> 143 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7325616">link</a></span></div><br>

We offer an integrated platform that combines the best fundraising, compliance, organizing, and new media products available.<p>We are a rapidly growing company that built the voter contact and volunteer management tools used by Obama for America. Nearly every State Democratic Party in the country distributes our VoteBuilder tools to Democrats up and down the ticket, and we provide industry-leading organizing tools for labor unions, environmental groups, pro-choice advocates, civil rights activists, and international political parties across the world. Our fundraising and compliance software is used by the vast majority of Democratic candidates from the Presidential level on down, and our fast-growing new media platform has recently become the most-used platform by Democratic campaigns as well.<p>We have a couple of positions open in DC for developers - our stack is mostly ASP.NET MVC _#x2F; EF, but we have several node apps and are also using angular pretty heavily in new stuff.  We_#x27;re also looking for a QA engineer in Boston, and we_#x27;re open to summer interns in both locations.<p>The positions offers competitive compensation and a strong benefits package.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Academia.edu, San Francisco, CA<p>Academia.edu is trying to improve the way that scientific publishing works. Here is the current way it works. A scientist does some experiments and writes up a paper. He sends it to a journal who sends it out to two or three peer reviewers. They peer review it, which means writing a page of comments on it, and recommending either accepting or rejecting it. Usually you get a few journal rejections and the average time-lag between finishing the paper and its being published is 12 months. Then the paper is behind a paywall and people have to pay $35 to read it.<p>Our view of scientific publishing is that when you finish the paper you should post it immediately on the internet. Peer review should be done post-publication, and it should be done by the community, Reddit-style, not by just two or three people. We believe peer review will be more robust that way. And the paper should be openly and freely accessible for anyone to read, along with the data and any accompanying materials like source code.<p>We believe that this will speed up science, and accelerate research into curing diseases, reducing infant mortality, and discovering clean energy amongst other things.<p>We are a mission-driven team based in San Francisco. We have raised $17 million from Khosla ventures and Spark Capital. Bijan Sabet from Spark Capital writes _quot;We believe open science is really important. We believe Academia.edu is going to have a profound impact on the world._quot;<p>Over 7 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 800k plus join up each month.
If you are a mission-driven person then you may enjoy the atmosphere at Academia.edu and the problems we are working on.<p>We are looking to hire full stack software engineers. Technologies we use include Ruby, Rails, Postgres, Mongo and Varnish. Our office is in downtown San Francisco.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">NODE.JS positions in Berlin_#x2F;Germany—all full-time and permanent<p>Top 5 reasons why you should move to Berlin, now:<p>1. Lowest livings costs with highest quality of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun. In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one and the rest applies for the hassle-free Blue Card.<p>5.

Our HQ is located in San Francisco, CA<p>Company Overview: Cotap helps people work better together. We’re building mobile tools to help people communicate and collaborate at work, whether they’re knowledge workers or line workers. Mobile phones can mean more than photo-sharing or checkins. They can mean better day-to-day work and more opportunities for people who were left out in the past.<p>What we are looking for: We’re looking for someone to help us build an amazing web experience, both for mobile and desktop. Our product is aimed primarily at mobile users, so it’s very important that our pages are responsive on smaller screens, touch-friendly, and lightweight, while also looking great on traditional desktop displays. We have a ridiculously talented set of engineers and we’re looking for a front-end developer to join us. You’ll have a ton of technical autonomy: should we use Ember, Backbone, something else, or nothing? You lead those decisions.<p>Why us:
We’re funded, which means we can pay competitive salaries and offer benefits. We’re also small, which means we don’t waste time on things like tracking vacation and sick days.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Back-end web developer - Cambridge_#x2F;Boston or New York City strongly preferred - PersonalGenomes.org 501(c)(3) _#x2F; Open Humans (<a href="http://openhumans.org" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;openhumans.org</a>)<p>As the Senior Software Engineer at PersonalGenomes.org you will work on the Open Humans Network, a project that aims to help people aggregate and share their health and trait data to advance scientific, educational and humanitarian causes.<p>Our model for this initiative is the work we’ve done on the Harvard Personal Genome Project (PGP), which has over 3,000 volunteers publicly sharing extensive biological and trait data, including hundreds of whole genomes, exomes, and genotyping data sets, over 1,000 health records, microbiome datasets from various bodily habitats, device data, brain imaging, etc. This combination of a highly informed and engaged community of volunteers and their contributions of extremely rich biological and health data, along with a network of collaboration-minded researchers, is an incredibly powerful scientific and educational resource that is unrivaled elsewhere. We will build on this momentum with this exciting new initiative that will transform participatory research and advance human health.<p>Our current hiring position is focusing on someone with back-end web development skills, as we have plans to work with a design firm for initial front-end work. Because we plan to develop open source software used by researchers, we believe Python (which many scientists use) is generally preferred.<p>We_#x27;re looking for someone who...<p>-- Is interested in building and managing a full-stack website. As the Senior Software Engineer, your expertise will be an important factor in decisions about what kind of technology is used and how it’s deployed.<p>-- Has used multiple programming languages to build production systems (e.g. Python, JavaScript, Ruby).<p>-- Is experienced with back-end web development (e.g. Django or Rails).<p>-- Is comfortable managing Unix servers, cloud-based services and has opinions about how to store and disseminate large datasets (currently around 50TB total, although we would start with managing _lt;10GB).<p>-- Works well in a small team of developers and scientists.<p>-- Loves science, participatory research, and free_#x2F;open source ideals.<p>-- Believes in our mission!<p>About us: PersonalGenomes.org is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization working to generate, aggregate and interpret human biological and trait data on an unprecedented scale. PersonalGenome.org_#x27;s mission is to make a wide spectrum of data about humans accessible to increase biological literacy and improve human health. Its efforts are informed by values encouraging greater transparency and collaboration between researchers and participants. The organization supports the Personal Genome Project (PGP) global network. The first PGP research study was founded at Harvard Medical School in 2005, and PGP sites now exist at leading institutions in four countries. We also produce the annual Genomes, Environments and Traits (GET) Conference.

We_#x27;re an enterprise SaaS company disrupting the fairly outdated enterprise education and training industry, an industry that has over 60% of its customers dissatisfied with current products!<p>We_#x27;ve seen significant progress within our first year of business. We signed a Fortune 200 company to a six figure contract within our first months and successfully launched to that company at the beginning of 2014.<p>Our product is built on top of a modern stack using best practices: an Angular client that communicates with a Rails 4 API, powered by Postgres, Redis, and Elasticsearch. We also have a strong focus on product and design (take a look at our product, and we think you_#x27;ll agree). Traditionally, enterprise software has lacked in these areas, but we aim to disrupt that tradition.<p>If you_#x27;re at all interested or curious in exploring an opportunity with us, please don_#x27;t hesitate to reach out to me at jamie[at]pathgather.com. We guarantee an amazing opportunity awaits: we_#x27;ll offer significant salary and equity, the chance to work on real problems experienced by a wide audience, opportunities and rewards for open source work and contributions, and influence in our product, culture, and vision from day one!</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7325386" href="vote?for=7325386_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%33%32%34%32%33%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7325386"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=olivercameron">olivercameron</a> 143 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7325386">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Secret Local: HALF-TIME_#x2F;FULL-TIME_#x2F;INTERN<p>Portland, OR or New York, NY<p>Hey guys... We got a great response on this back in January and now we are expanding.... So here is an updated version now that we are a team of two hiring.<p>Hey, HN. One of you is perfect for this idea.<p>We are two serial entrepreneurs currently trapped in the professions of being a freelance contractor. We have relatively stable 40 hour a week projects, and incoming projects as well that I generally can_#x27;t take due to lack of resources (time, the most precious one)<p>So here_#x27;s the idea.
You. Are interesting and have some experience in coding (webapps, mobile, whatever) would be a coding apprentice.
I would give you a guaranteed 20 hour a week gig for now, and flex additional work as it comes in and you are available.
(also now looking for 40 hours)<p>You would work on entrepreneurial ideas and contracts and get paid for doing so. If something took off the ground we could negotiate revenue_#x2F;equity, but no matter what you will be getting paid.<p>Here is what you get.
Money
Freedom and Flexibility (need the day off to deal with a hangover because you are in college and its friday?)
Real World Education
Ability to become a killer coder
and whatever else. we are pretty flexible<p>Languages?
Python_#x2F;Ruby Obj-C Javascript(Node)
You name it.
If you can show competency in some language we currently do, then we can work together and you can get paid to learn and become an expert at any other languages as required.<p>About us, your _#x27;bosses_#x27;.
Boss #1 (Portland Office)
Early 30s. Built several large-scale enterprise applications used by Fortune 500 companies. Lead engineering and product for a VC-funded healthcare startup. Last company built infrastructure that stored over 1 billion objects and transferred hundreds thousand objects per day.<p>Currently living in PDX (Inner SE) and renting a space at a co-working facility. Open to having you work here, or at my house. I prefer day hours, 10-6pm PST, but I am flexible.<p>Boss #2 (New York Office)
Late 20s. Been in and out of various startups. Started ideas from scratch. Reasonably connected in the _#x27;valley_#x27;. No stranger to a term sheet. I have done hiring for a YC company.  Been on both the business and engineering side of places.<p>Currently living in NYC (manhattan) with enough room for you to come clock hours, but you can be remote as well, or both.
I have been travelling a lot because it means that working 9-5 EST is a much more reasonable 12-8 or even sometimes 9pm - 5am.<p>I like tinkering with OSS and hardware too, obsessed with gadgets.<p>==============
tl;dr
Long story short, you will get paid to learn how to code in the real world, become an entrepreneur or freelancer (or both) and then hopefully be able to repeat this process.<p>You_#x27;ll get hands on attention and code reviews without some PM breathing down your neck. (unless you are working on a project that requires it).<p>We_#x27;ll figure out a good hourly rate, and when you are working on a project that is paid, probably double it. And then fall back to the normal rate when we are working on whatever random ideas I want to incubate.<p>email hn0314@boun.cr with a little bit about yourself, a resume if you have it, and most importantly either a github or code sample.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7326979" href="vote?for=7326979_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%51%50%76%71%33%53%45%6a%4c%4e%6d%58%64%51%31%33%49%42%48%65%57%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7326979"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=exhaze">exhaze</a> 143 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7326979">link</a></span></div><br>

About OpenEye Scientific Software, Inc: OpenEye Scientific Software provides software to the pharmaceuticals industry for molecular modeling and cheminformatics. It has done so since 1997 in its continuing mission to provide novel software, new science and better business practices to the industry. Central to our approach is the importance of shape and electrostatics as primary variables of molecular description, platform-independent code for high-throughput 2D and 3D modeling, and a preference for the rigorous rather than the ad hoc. With offices in the United States, Germany _amp; Japan, OpenEye Scientific Software is a global company. However, with fewer than 50 employees we offer a unique working culture. We believe that work should be fun and our working environment supports this philosophy. For the third year we have been a recipient of the Alfred P.

The problem is real, and we_#x27;re solving it.<p>The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading cleaning operations, a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition, and a former Army Ranger managing our driver corps. I_#x27;m Stanford CS_#x2F;EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business. The tech stack is Heroku _#x2F; Python _#x2F; Django _#x2F; Celery _#x2F; Phonegap _#x2F; JQuery _#x2F; Backbone _#x2F; Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well. We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.<p>We_#x27;re looking for a Full-Stack Developer to develop interactivity for our customers and tools for our staff. We_#x27;re doing things like route scheduling and planning, e-commerce funnel optimization, and analytics gathering for data-driven decision making.<p>We_#x27;re also looking for a Director of Marketing. Rinse is a quintessential B2C business, with plenty of opportunities for online advertising, offline collateral, partnerships, and _#x27;growth hacking._#x27; We_#x27;re building a scalable business model and the technology to support it, now help us scale the business. Please see a job description at <a href="http://bit.ly/1dLJigo" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;bit.ly_#x2F;1dLJigo</a> - The sky_#x27;s the limit!<p>Finally, if anyone in San Francisco is looking to make a few extra dollars part-time, Rinse is hiring part-time Associates to help us deliver clothes. We pay $25 per hour for a handful of hours per week. Perhaps it would be a way for some of you bootstrapping startups to earn a little extra cash?

This growth in data means that we need an effective way to store massive amounts of data. OpenStack Swift is designed to effectively store massive amounts of data while providing high durability, high availability, and support massive concurrency across the entire data set. SwiftStack is building management, monitoring, and integration tools to turn the Swift storage engine into an effective storage solution that is used by millions, daily.<p>We_#x27;re looking for engineers of all experience levels to join us. We do most of our work in Python, but we_#x27;ve got some Ruby, Javascript, and a few other things mixed into our stack.<p>So far this year, we_#x27;ve built out global clusters for a major expense reporting and travel support site[1], provided the storage system for Disney Interactive_#x27;s gaming platform[2], and integrated Swift into radical new hard drive technology from Seagate[3]. We_#x27;re currently working with companies like Intel and Box to build support for erasure codes into Swift[4].<p>My vision for OpenStack Swift is that it will be used by everyone, every day, even if they don_#x27;t realize it. Swift is storage that is built for the web and already powers some of the world_#x27;s largest storage clouds. I would like to work with you at SwiftStack to see this vision become a reality.<p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done. Tell us in a few lines of text why you’re interested in SwiftStack, and why we’ll be interested in you. We’ll be back in touch shortly to get the conversation started.<p>[1] Concur video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQmGfzewWQw_amp;t=29m23s" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.youtube.com_#x2F;watch?v=qQmGfzewWQw_amp;t=29m23s</a><p>[2] Disney + SwiftStack: <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/08/30/how-disney-built-a-giant-cloud-by-bolting-two-together/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;venturebeat.com_#x2F;2013_#x2F;08_#x2F;30_#x2F;how-disney-built-a-giant-c...</a><p>[3] SwiftStack + Seagate: <a href="http://swiftstack.com/blog/2013/10/22/kinetic-for-openstack-swift-with-seagate/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;swiftstack.com_#x2F;blog_#x2F;2013_#x2F;10_#x2F;22_#x2F;kinetic-for-openstack-...</a><p>[4] Building erasure codes into OpenStack Swift: <a href="http://swiftstack.com/blog/2013/07/17/erasure-codes-with-openstack-swift-digging-deeper/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;swiftstack.com_#x2F;blog_#x2F;2013_#x2F;07_#x2F;17_#x2F;erasure-codes-with-ope...</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7326445" href="vote?for=7326445_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%51%50%76%71%33%53%45%6a%4c%4e%6d%58%64%51%31%33%49%42%48%65%57%35"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7326445"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=timv">timv</a> 143 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7326445">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;ve grown 100% quarter over quarter all last year.

You should enjoy solving tricky problems and be a great communicator, in person, on the phone and in writing. We_#x27;re looking for a few different roles: one would be a recent college grad who is ready for the startup experience, and another for someone with a couple of years of experience in banking or consulting.

  - Design and write performant, beautiful interfaces 
  - Write software to build machine learned user models 
  - Make data visualizations for our email and user data 
  - Design an immutable infrastructure for our platform

You love numbers and analytics, or the front-end and making things look and interact beautifully, or both. You grow and learn every day.  We are in Portland, Maine which is atypical for Hacker News, but is a great place to live! We aren_#x27;t looking for remote workers at this time.<p>We are a tech-startup-spinoff of the award-winning (NYC-based) agency Likeable Media, and we are looking for people that are willing to jump right in and be on our small team creating features that will be visible and impactful and used immediately.<p>We are hard-working and smart, and we love to solve challenging problems.

You are self-disciplined, self-directed, but also detail-oriented in your communication about what choices you make and what you are doing.<p>Our product is an integrated software solution that allows small businesses to create, enhance and manage their social media presence. Likeable Local was founded in 2012 and has a deployed product that integrates with Facebook and Twitter.

    check us out at www.kiratalent.com_#x2F;about_#x2F;

  - we’re had paying clients since day 1 of the company, and are well funded

  - we’re hiring both  mobile and backend developers

  - we believe that even enterprise software can be beautiful, 
    and pride ourselves on our design 

  - every single one of our developers have committed code within their
    first day at work (some within their first hour), and because
    we love continuous deployment, so we_#x27;re constantly pushing to
    production and seeing the impact of our work
</code></pre>
Here’s some stuff we’ve been working on lately:<p><pre><code>  - building infrastructure to allow us to scale our video recording 
    and streaming; imagine thousands of applicants from countries 
    all around the world submitting video interviews right before a deadline

  - designing and creating our mobile suite for both job candidates and
    employers alike 

  - presenting analytics data captured in our product to the end user,
    and our team internally
</code></pre>
Our toolkit involves Python (Django), JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS), MySQL (and some MongoDB), Celery, RabbitMQ, Wowza Media Server. We use AWS for hosting, CircleCI for continuous integration and GitHub for everything else (i.e. code reviews, issue tracking).<p>If this sounds fun, let’s chat!

Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and deployed on Amazon Web Services using Puppet and Capistrano; we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, at the moment we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment. Our developers are generalizing specialists whose typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, tuning a SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we_#x27;d like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who_#x27;d like to join us; we_#x27;re hiring for all technical roles, especially developers of all levels of experience.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is the UK_#x27;s leading private shopping club, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.

We generated $333,000 in February, and we have $520,000 in the bank. The average salary at the company is $98,000 and our total funding to date is $450,000 which we raised in December 2011, for which we gave up 14% of the company. I_#x27;m sharing all of this because one of the highest values we have at Buffer is to be fully transparent, and I_#x27;d love for you to be part of the incredible journey we_#x27;ve embarked upon.<p>At 16% month over month revenue growth on average in the last 6 months, we_#x27;re seeing increasing demand to build out the product further and help our fast-growing customer base with all their social media problems. To achieve this, we_#x27;d love your help with some interesting engineering challenges.<p>Do any of these areas stand out for you? I_#x27;d really love to hear from you:<p><pre><code>    - Reliability Hacker (we_#x27;re sending 400,000 posts to social networks every day,
      our architecture is still not ideal)
    - Happiness (Support) Hacker (we have a crazy obsession for customer happiness
      and want to build our own tools to go beyond what_#x27;s normal)
    - Android Lead (our Android app has half a million downloads but currently no
      full-time developer!)
    - iOS Hacker (our favorite people who use Buffer are all crying out for an
      iPad app)
    - Growth Hacker (our landing page conversion is at 7%, we_#x27;d love your help
      improving it and many other metrics)
    - Frontend Hacker (last month 130,000 people used Buffer, we_#x27;d love to improve
      our dashboard interface and extensions for them)
</code></pre>
Some of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS).<p><pre><code>    - We_#x27;re completely open about salary and equity, in fact here is a spreadsheet
      of all individual salaries: https:_#x2F;_#x2F;docs.google.com_#x2F;a_#x2F;bufferapp.com_#x2F;spreadsheet_#x2F;ccc?key=0AgrWVeoG5divdE81a2wzcHYxV1pacWE1UjM3V0w0MUE_amp;usp=drive_web#gid=1.
      It_#x27;s most likely you_#x27;d fall into a range of $85,000-$120,000 and 0.1%-1%.
    - We_#x27;re a fully distributed remote team, and we come together 3 times a year for
      super fun retreats. The last one was in Thailand in December, our next is
      Cape Town in April!
    - We have a big focus on culture, that_#x27;s the main thing we think about when someone
      joins the team. Here is our slide deck of values: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.slideshare.net_#x2F;Bufferapp_#x2F;buffer-culture-03

We don_#x27;t have a designer, so having an eye towards good UX_#x2F;UI is a plus.<p>We_#x27;re also looking for someone at the CTO level.<p>DaisyBill is located at 34 W 15th Street in Manhattan. We_#x27;re a SaaS vendor serving the workers_#x27; compensation e-billing market.<p>Workers_#x27; comp is a vastly underserved part of the medical e-billing trade which has been a struggle for all parties involved: the injured worker, the practice that treats the injured worker, and the insurance companies that handle the claims_#x2F;bills. Electronic billing aims to make the situation better.<p>DaisyBill manages the entire billing process, both generating and sending the bill electronically and managing the responses about the status of the bill, including when it was paid and how much. As a result of using DaisyBill, practices are paid more quickly and accurately than when they submit bills via paper_#x2F;snail mail. We_#x27;re talking 15 days instead of 60, 90, or more, if at all.  This makes practices more likely to take on injured workers as patients, an obvious benefit for all parties.<p>You can read more about our service offering at www.daisybill.com.<p>The stack we currently run is Rails 3 on Heroku.<p>We use Git for source control and use Macs for development. We develop in an agile manner in the style of ThoughtWorks and Pivotal Labs, using Pivotal Tracker.

The product we are building is a fully-responsive HTML5 web application used on tablets, desktops, laptops and smartphones. We think that in educational software, usability and design have not been given enough attention so we assign a lot of importance to good UX and clean user interfaces. The stack consists of a REST API implemented in Ruby on Rails and a thick-client front-end based on the Ember.js framework.<p>We’re looking for a full-stack web developer with a passion for web development, who is well-versed in both Ruby and Javascript and who has a good sense of UX. Experience in the development of single-page apps (Ember.js, Angular, Backbone or other) is highly valued.<p>You will be<p><pre><code>    - Adding new features to the application, from extending the REST API to
      writing the CSS
    - Contributing to all phases of building a great product
    - Working in a small team of developers
    - Working remotely is fine but we would like you to join our office at
      least once every two weeks

The application we’re building is changing the way K-12 students study history today. You will be an early member of Hstry and you will work with interesting web technologies in an agile environment at the LearnLaunchX offices in downtown Boston, within a team that can bring ideas to market.<p>Employee equity packages are on offer.<p>Interested?

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Taskflow.io - Business Development - Chicago, IL<p>COMPANY DESCRIPTION
Taskflow.io is a brand new idea on how businesses can run their internal processes. Every business has reoccurring processes that are in the heads of the employees and not formalized or tracked.<p>When a business process is only in the head of a couple of employees things get forgotten, important data gets lost, critical steps are missed, and performance analytics are lost.<p>Taskflow.io formalizes business processes online into a clean and easy interface to run a business_#x27;s operations. Taskflow.io collects data on each step a business process, so nothing falls between the cracks and process performance can be easily tracked.<p>JOB DESCRIPTION
You will be responsible for two things generating clients and keeping them happy. That_#x27;s it. How you reach your goals is up to you.<p>There are no scripts, there are no mandatory daily requirements. If you are independent and diligent in generating clients and keeping them happy, you will have no problem in this position.

So, we gave him a 24-hour coding quiz, he passed it, we gave him a round of phone interviews, and he passed that too.<p>Two weeks later, he was in our office writing Rails and JavaScript as our first summer intern.<p>The best part?

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Copenhagen, Denmark — Stealth Company is Hiring an iOS Developer<p>After going through a famous US incubator and raising money from a who’s who of silicon valley investors, we have finalized a fundamental new technology that enables app developers to handle a lot more data in a lot less time and at a fraction of the battery life. But above all, our technology lets you manipulate data in a way that is extremely intuitive and a joy to use compared to today’s data frameworks: you get native data structures that you can just iterate on, standard access methods, and all the good stuff you’d expect to be able to do in the 21st century. Thanks to this, developers are able to develop apps much faster, but also deliver on use-cases that are impossible to conceive today.<p>We are now looking for a native iOS developer with at least 2 years full-time experience who can help us refine the product, make our native interface even more delightful, and build next-generation apps using it.<p>We offer competitive salary, stock options, catered lunches and all the usuals bells _amp; whistles.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">San Francisco<p>Intrans<p>Ruby Engineer<p>The last 50 years have seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Intrans is here to change that. We_#x27;ve deployed the world_#x27;s first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping.<p>Over 30 billion dollars a month is spent on trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it_#x27;s hard to believe that the entire industry still runs on landlines and fax machines. We are changing that by using location-based technology to automatically match supply and demand.
We_#x27;re a team of 10 and have been around for over two years. We_#x27;re growing quickly and looking for a Ruby engineer to join us.<p>If you_#x27;re ready to be part of this industrial transformation, send your resume and GitHub profile to sean@intrans.com.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7339174" href="vote?for=7339174_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4d%44%62%69%31%4f%66%39%6b%4d%6b%6f%65%4a%70%79%78%5a%4b%31%58%52"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7339174"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=justkez">justkez</a> 140 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7339174">link</a></span></div><br>

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 80 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We_#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.<p>==================================<p>Engineer (DevOps)<p>You can work with cloud hosting platforms such as EC2, and modern deployment tools such as Chef or Puppet. You enjoy the detective work of solving server problems through the strategic use of metrics and logging.<p>==================================<p>Engineer (BackEnd)<p>You speak fluently about distributed architectures and API design. You can think about large-scale web systems both in terms of big-picture concerns, and in terms of nitty-gritty optimizations.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7325599" href="vote?for=7325599_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%62%44%32%30%50%49%34%59%63%67%34%68%57%49%6c%4e%46%33%52%4c%30%36"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7325599"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=essrand">essrand</a> 143 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7325599">link</a></span></div><br>

Sixty percent of all workers work hourly jobs, including over 75 million Americans. And we already have international customers.<p>Our 3,000 customers today have over 200,000 employees. We_#x27;re expecting to triple our customer base this year. We have already exceeded $1 million in annual revenue and we didn_#x27;t hire any sales staff to do it. We_#x27;re growing at over ten percent per month.<p>After raising $4 million in our series A fundraising round, we have four immediate on-site openings:<p><pre><code>  DevOps Engineer
  Lead Business Analyst _#x2F; Data Hacker
  Android Engineer
  iOS Engineer

  - Do you have experience working on solid mobile or web apps?
  - Do you take the time upfront to architect maintainable solutions?
  - Do you balance your work and life, but also spend time growing your skills?
  - Are you ready to upset the human resources industry?
  - Do you rock an ironic ZZ Top beard?
  (Quite unnecessary, but you would totally get along with our designer.)

But internships are built for learning, so if you_#x27;re shaky on these, that_#x27;s okay! We love teaching and mentoring.<p>Internships at Whiteboard are always paid. We look for people who fit both culture and business needs, and who are highly motivated and teachable.<p>Email me directly (email is in my bio) if you_#x27;re interested!</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7324571" href="vote?for=7324571_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%36%4d%75%5a%7a%46%6d%56%4b%33%78%56%62%31%32%73%51%65%4d%63%58%44"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7324571"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jasonlotito">jasonlotito</a> 143 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7324571">link</a></span></div><br>
