<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michigan<p><a href="http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com_#x2F;</a><p>---------------------------------------<p>We are a small team passionate about making people_#x27;s lives better through software.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US
  
  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don_#x27;t artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I_#x27;ve worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside 
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and _gt; 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.
  
  - We_#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health_#x2F;vision_#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit 
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;beeradvocate.com_#x2F;beerfly_#x2F;city_#x2F;43
  
  - If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.
  
  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.
</code></pre>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>IFTTT - <a href="https://ifttt.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;ifttt.com_#x2F;jobs</a> - San Francisco, CA<p>==================================<p>IFTTT is looking for engineers to help build the next generation of its platform. This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We_#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.<p>==================================<p>Mobile Engineer<p>Earlier this month we released our first mobile app, IFTTT for iPhone (<a href="https://ifttt.com/mobile" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;ifttt.com_#x2F;mobile</a>). The response has been overwhelmingly positive (Editor_#x27;s Choice, #1 Productivity). We_#x27;re looking for talented mobile developers who can help us continue to innovate on iPhone, as well as bringing IFTTT to new platforms (Android, wearable computing, embedded systems, etc).<p>==================================<p>Platform Engineer<p>We’re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we’re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6141325_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%31%33%39%39%32%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6141130 href="vote?for=6141130_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%31%33%39%39%32%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6141130></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dljsjr">dljsjr</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6141130">link</a></span></div><br>

So, you check us out at <a href="http://www.interfacevision.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.interfacevision.com</a>.<p>Wow, you think. A visual language of some kind?

* Optimally, we would like you to be with us in Santa Cruz, CA. However, if we can pull it off, you can work from anywhere (We’re going to be implementing remote collaboration, so we might as well eat our own dog food).
* The magic is done in C# Mono with Xamarin.iOS and Xamarion.Android (www.xamarin.com). Xamarin is an awesome company. Go check them out if you haven’t already.
* We don’t have a specific software development position to fill so tell us what you would bring to the table and what you want to do - we will listen to everyone.
* We really need help extending our GUI for both iOS and Android.
* We are interested in extending our framework to include OpenCL, OpenGL, REST (and general API support), extensive math library, etc.<p>Your Abilities:

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA. Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company_#x27;s mission is to accelerate the world_#x27;s research. 3.7m academics have joined Academia.edu, and over 300k join each month.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to make science faster and more open. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to make publishing a button, and the distribution of scientific ideas instant.<p>- Better peer review. Currently two people peer review a paper, which is too small a sample size. With 50,000 people worldwide in a research community like Machine Learning, or breast cancer, what 2 people think is not statistically significant. We need a broader-based peer review process, one that surfaces the opinions from the entire scientific community.<p>- Data-sets. Scientists don_#x27;t share their data-sets right now. The data remains stuck on their hard-drives. The main reason for this is a lack of incentives for the scientists to share their data. We need to introduce the right reputation mechanisms in science to facilitate the sharing of data. -<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.<p>We_#x27;re a 12-person engineering-driven team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb.<p>We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>We are looking to hire software engineers to help build a faster and more open science.<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href="http://academia.edu/hiring" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;academia.edu_#x2F;hiring</a>.

The role description (at <a href="http://spoti.fi/13zEPmT" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;spoti.fi_#x2F;13zEPmT</a>) should give you some idea: my team is building the infrastructure that all devs at Spotify use to build their features and services on top of. Great way to make a big impact, and also involves playing with a lot of fun tech like Cassandra, LXC, and Docker :-)<p>I_#x27;ve been at Spotify for a year and a half and it has been a great place to work as a developer. Let me just list the ways:<p><pre><code>    - Really smart people with very diverse professional and cultural backgrounds.
    - Problems that are actually pretty tough _amp; challenging at scale.
    - A hacker culture, where solving or building things is what_#x27;s valued.
    - Getting to travel between our offices and exploring new places.
    - Speaking of travel, 4-5 weeks of vacation depending on your location.
    - Excellent events with great music and bands (look up _quot;Spotify Sessions_quot;)!
</code></pre>

  * iOS Developer (you know, iOS)
  * Full stack software engineer (Rails)
</code></pre>
Over the past few years, Rap Genius has gone from tiny side-project to one of the biggest music sites on the internet. We’ve raised 15 mil from some pretty dope investors and grown to employ some of the most talented devs this world has ever seen. We’re expanding from explaining rap into ALL OF TEXT, starting with poetry, rock, and news. Now were looking for genius full-stack web and iOS developers to help build the “Internet Talmud”, the one platform for explaining the world’s primary source texts.<p>Why would you want to work for us?<p><pre><code>  * One of the fastest-growing sites on the internet, SERIOUSLY THIS IS BASED ON
    ACTUAL NUMBERS.
  * Tiny, quick-shipping team with a ton of autonomy – so you never think to yourself:
    “what did i accomplish this year_#x2F;month_#x2F;30 seconds ago?”
  * A development and design agenda that is led by developers and designers –
    so no marketing or product people telling you how the image carousel should work.
  * Gym in building, free food, sweet benefits, whatever computer you want, more
    money than your last job, equity, etc.
  * Live in New York, where a new restaurant is born every 1.5 seconds!
</code></pre>
A little about the dev team:<p><pre><code>  * Seven people total: five backend, one front-end_#x2F;design, and one TOTALLY
    SICK intern.
  * Independently led projects.
  * We iterate quickly and push code to production constantly.
    We_#x27;re not afraid to put the _quot;first draft_quot; of a feature in production
    to see how it behaves in the wild before perfecting it.
  * Projects and priorities are determined communally (usually over burritos).
  * Ruby on Rails via Heroku + Sass, Compass, jQuery, Git, and more!
</code></pre>
More about the positions:<p>Are you a boss front-end developer with an eye for design? Hit us up. A bomb iOS developer who wants to build the Rap Genius iPhone app from the ground up? An experienced and creative full-stack Rails engineer? We’ve been waiting for you. Send us your deets.<p>Interested? Hit us up at jobs@rapgenius.com with:<p><pre><code>  * Your name and online identity – i.e., your Twitter, Github, blog,
    Stack Overflow account, personal website, etc.
    The more info the better.
  * Location – you can’t get the true RG cult effect working remotely, so only apply
    if you live in NYC or are willing to relocate.
    Our office is in Williamsburg.
  * Educational background and_#x2F;or most recent job
  * A little bit about your technical background,
    including something brief about what you like
    and dislike about the technologies you’ve used.
  * If you come in for an interview, you’ll start by making a short
    technical presentation to the team and taking their questions.
    What will you present?
  * THE MOST IMPORTANT: What have you built online that you’re proud of?</code></pre></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6140214_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%31%33%39%39%32%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6140416 href="vote?for=6140416_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%31%33%39%39%32%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6140416></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Peroni">Peroni</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6140416">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA -- Standard Treasury -- Full-Time<p><i>Opportunity</i><p>Standard Treasury builds software for banks. That might seem boring, but everyone uses a bank and we dream of making their technology simple, beautiful, and intuitive. Think about your online banking system with its outdated, unpleasant UI and UX — we’re working to fix that. To get some idea of the market: U.S. banks spend $400 billion dollar per year on IT.<p>See <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/09/standard-treasury/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;techcrunch.com_#x2F;2013_#x2F;07_#x2F;09_#x2F;standard-treasury_#x2F;</a> for some more information.<p>Email us at hiring@standardtreasury.com<p><i>Product</i><p>Our first product is a white-labeled API interface and developer experience that we’ll sell to banks. Our technology enables banks to programmatically offer their services to their clients using modern, RESTful APIs. From here we plan on expanding into desktop online banking, mobile banking, and core banking (the systems that record teller transactions, and how much money everyone has in their bank accounts).<p><i>Traction</i><p>We have significant traction on our API product with several top-25 banks. The price points of these contracts range from $1 million to over $5 million per year. With these contract sizes and a growing customer base; we have an opportunity to avoid any significant equity dilution with a traditional fundraising round.<p><i>Team</i><p>We are a small team based in San Francisco focused on unsexy but incredibly valuable services that will change the face of banking and we are looking for the right people to join us. We are building a team of excellent people who work hard and don’t tolerate bullshit. We want passionate partners who share our desire to shake up banking software.
We practice internal transparency a la Stripe (<a href="http://bit.ly/VSv54h" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;bit.ly_#x2F;VSv54h</a>) and corporate candor.<p>Email us at hiring@standardtreasury.com<p><i>Compensation and Perks</i><p>You can expect:<p>1. Great benefits. Medical, vision, and dental insurance for you and your dependents.<p>2. Great comp. Salary and equity. Critically, we’re interested in finding the right balance for you. We know there are some people who have a greater risk appetite than others.<p>3. Great perks. Free lunch and dinner, snacks, a stocked fridge, laundry service, gym membership, Clipper card, house cleaning by Exec or Homejoy, and delivery errands by Postmates.<p>4. Great flexibility.
(a) Flexible hours. So that you can live your life.
(b) Open vacation policy. We all need to recharge. We mean it — there is a two week minimum and we’ll send you home in December if we have to.
(c) Paid maternity and paternity leave.<p>5. Great tools. Build your ideal workstations so you can have the tools you want and need. Buy the books you need or want on Amazon. Need a Kindle for your commute — get it. The corporate Amex can be used for all expenses under a standard of trust _amp; reasonableness.<p><i>Roles</i><p>We are hiring as quickly as we can find good people in a large number of roles.<p>1. Platform and APIs. For those who think they can build something as beautiful and durable as Twilio, Stripe, or Facebook Connect.<p>2. UI, UX, and design. This will start with easy-to-use API documentation and intuitive websites. In the future it will expand into the future of online (and mobile) banking.<p>3. Bank integrations. Half our job is taking pre-modern internal banking systems and making them disappear for our users. This requires patience and, fortunately or unfortunately, a deep love of puzzles.<p>4. Systems and security. We integrate with some of the most sensitive and secure systems in the world. We need to be even better. A security breach will kill our company.<p>5. Define your own role. Let us know what you want to work on to disrupt banking software.<p>Email us at hiring@standardtreasury.com</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6141914_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%31%33%39%39%32%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6143129 href="vote?for=6143129_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%31%33%39%39%32%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6143129></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kapad">kapad</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6143129">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything. We design and implement our own trading strategies and infrastructure, down to the networking code that ties us in to financial markets. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy or on infrastructure.<p>No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of a project that a member of our infrastructure team could work on is a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss. Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Please visit <a href="http://amacapital.net/careers.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;amacapital.net_#x2F;careers.html</a> to learn more, and, if interested, apply to careers@amacapital.net.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6140055_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%31%33%39%39%32%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6140429 href="vote?for=6140429_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%31%33%39%39%32%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6140429></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ultimoo">ultimoo</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6140429">link</a></span></div><br>

Aircloak is a young and well-funded startup working on privacy preserving data processing and analytics. We are a spinout from the German Max-Planck Institute for Software System research institute, where we also currently have our offices.<p>Our technology allows us to process highly private streams of data and only ever make fully anonymous data available to our customers. One of the features that make our system unique is that no one, including operators, customers, and ourselves, ever has access to the sensitive raw data. This property holds true even after we update the software running on the machines processing the sensitive data!<p>You should:<p><pre><code>    - be intelligent
    - have a good sense of humour
    - be an amazing programmer
    - wish to change the world
</code></pre>
Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.<p>We are:<p><pre><code>    - recent University of Cambridge graduates 
    - one director at the Max-Planck Institute
</code></pre>
The work environment is highly international and diverse, and we would like to keep it that way. We are looking to hire two more full time engineers. You can either work on site with us in our offices in Kaiserslautern, Germany, or, for the right candidate, remote. We offer good and stable salary, generous equity and great facilities.<p>We hope to hear from you. Please email us at jobs@aircloak.com if you have any questions!

We build software for The Modern Educator.<p>Django, JS, RabbitMQ, AWS, Backbone, Real Time, Big Data, EdTech, Dent in the universe kind of stuff.<p>-----------------------<p>Looking for a brilliant developer:<p>Does doin’ your thing in Django take you to your happy place? Does coding in JavaScript feel better than Christmas morning? Does programming in JavaScript bring you more satisfaction than rainbows and puppies combined? Read on, you Maniac Hack. Read on.<p>If you’ve been to university, you understand the nut Top Hat is trying to crack. Your professor starts to talk, and you really do have every intention of listening. But within about five minutes, your good intentions fly out the window and you begin to surf Facebook, catch some Zz’s, or if you’re feeling really ambitious start working on a problem set for a completely unrelated class. When you join our team, you’ll be working on classroom interaction software and help higher education find its mojo!<p>Your work will touch hundreds of thousands of paying customers (300,000 and growing every day). Plus, you’ll get to ship code on a weekly basis. We only officially launched a little over two years ago, but we’re already profitable and are growing like crazy! Lucky for you, we’re small but mighty. That means you get to touch everything—front-end, back-end, database code—whatever your little hacker heart desires! And what’s more? Everything you touch will be yours. Well, kind of. We follow the “Facebook approach,” meaning we give developers complete ownership of features.<p>The Fabulous Life of the Top Hat Developer comes with other sweet perks too. Every fifth week is hack-week, where you and your fellow developers get to spend a week working on pet projects. There’s also lots of free deliciousness. What’s up catered breakfast and unlimited snacks and drinks? Oh, and did we mention StarCraft throw-downs at lunch?<p><a href="https://tophat.com/about/jobs" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;tophat.com_#x2F;about_#x2F;jobs</a>

REMOTE posible for proven cantidades.<p>We need a few versatile coders_#x2F;data scientists who are willing to tackle hard problems as we analyze the data from large biomedical studies like The Cancer Genome Atlas.<p>We run massively parallel analysis, warehouse data and present it using interactive html5 visualizations and are seeking coders who can contribute to all or part of that process. The abilities to self manage and work directly with scientists are a must.<p>Things we use:
* Linux
* Go (golang), python (numpy, scipy), javascript (d3.js, node.js in dev), R, C, C++
* HTML5, websockets, REST, json
* mongo, neo4j, solr_#x2F;lucene, sql
* random forests, boolean networks, information theory, statistics and [spectral] graph theory<p>Things we don_#x27;t use:
* Hadoop<p>We are a largely grant funded non profit with a mandate to open source code. You may have seen our analysis  running on 600,000 cores streaming results to a webapp during the compute engine demo at last years Google IO.<p>See _quot;Shumelevich Lab_quot; postings here:

paul at refresh.io<p>Title: _quot;Rather Impressive Java Developer_quot;<p>Our current dev team is pretty awesome and we_#x27;re looking to add to it. Currently we have a few PhD_#x27;s, few ex-googler_#x27;s, some tech book authors, couple of ex-linkedin, ex-microsofties, and stanfords, and a bunch of startup vets like Trulia and dealer.com. Heck we even have the guy who wrote the Java testing framework TestNG ( <a href="http://www.testng.org" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.testng.org</a> ) and the guy who wrote Mailinator ( <a href="http://mailinator.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;mailinator.blogspot.com</a> ). And we_#x27;re only up to 7 people.  But we want an 8th and maybe a 9th.<p>Job Description:  
Someone we want to work with. Someone who will make us smarter and better and, in return, someone we can make smarter and better too. Someone who will help us make our company and its products great.<p>Our technology includes: 
Java. Thousands of threads (Mailinator guy keeps adding more, TestNG guy keeps removing them). Tons of data, tremendous data analysis, fuzzy logic, machine learning, natural language processing. We use Mongo and we_#x27;re having no problems with it - because we_#x27;re careful. We treat every  superfluous database access and every unnecessary network call like its a small insult to our users. And gosh darn it, we love our users.<p>Simply, we are building a product that fetches and analyzes massive amounts of data to improve our user_#x27;s lives (see the website for a more specific description, or better yet, email me)<p>Job Requirements: 
You know Java (or at least you_#x27;re willing to learn it) - but hands-down you know some computer language cold.  You know it well enough to hate parts of it but yet probably understand why they_#x27;re there.  You get why algorithms are important and know when to implement them and sometimes, when its better to just do it the easy way. You understand that startups experiment a lot - and consequently discover amazing things occasionally, but throw away code far more often.<p>The static credentials on your resume are great but honestly, its the dynamic stuff we_#x27;re more interested in.<p>You_#x27;ve done stuff. You_#x27;re proud of the stuff you_#x27;ve done. You can show us - heck, you can_#x27;t wait to show us. It might be an iphone app, or an open source project, or a thread-safe cache-invalidation scheme, or a javascript game, or maybe you launched a startup. Either which way - you built something - start to finish. You can deliver.<p>The interview:<p>We love solving problems  and every interview question we ask is based on something we_#x27;ve actually had to code.  So we sometimes get rather excited to find a smart person willing to solve a problem a new way with us on a whiteboard. You should think this way too - you don_#x27;t rate interviews as being easy or hard - you rate them as being boring or fun. And we definitely shoot for fun.  Right answers aren_#x27;t the point - finding a good attack vector on the problem is.<p>Our CTO_#x27;s take on getting your resume Silicon Valley ready:  <a href="http://paultyma.blogspot.com/2012/05/how-to-get-your-resume-silicon-valley.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;paultyma.blogspot.com_#x2F;2012_#x2F;05_#x2F;how-to-get-your-resume-...</a></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6144356_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%31%33%39%39%32%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6140447 href="vote?for=6140447_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%31%33%39%39%32%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6140447></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=hswolff">hswolff</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6140447">link</a></span></div><br>

  * we’re well funded and have had paying clients since day 1 of the company

  * we’re hiring designers and all types of devs -- mobile, frontend, backend, analytics

  * we think even enterprise software can be beautiful, and pride ourselves on our design

  * every single one of our developers have committed code within their first day at work; some within their first hour

Here’s some stuff we’ve been working on lately:<p><pre><code>  * building infrastructure to allow us to scale our video recording and streaming

  * re-building the UI-heavy sections of our product using AngularJS

  * designing and creating our mobile suite for both job candidates and employers alike

  * presenting analytics data captured in our product to the end user, and our team internally
</code></pre>
We use Python_#x2F;Django, JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS), ActionScript, MySQL (and some MongoDB), but you’d be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>If this sounds fun, let’s chat!

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA - Full-time, permanent - MuleSoft<p>Sr. Javascript UI Engineer<p>Why should you join MuleSoft?<p>Every major company is adopting more and more cloud services, AND building lots of apps themselves, AND publishing their own APIs. We_#x27;re talking hundreds to thousands of integration points for a single reasonably-large enterprise to glue together. In fact, increasingly the heart of a company_#x27;s applications is in the glue itself. And that makes for an exponentially-big problem for enterprises: how do you assemble numerous services into coherent business flows, efficiently and effectively, then operate them for months and years, and keep them up to date as all these APIs evolve? How do you even know all the integration endpoints and flows you have at any given time?
At MuleSoft, we_#x27;re already solving this for thousands of companies, but now we_#x27;re taking it to the next level, with CloudHub: a cloud-based environment which pairs with the widely-adopted on-premise Mule _quot;bus_quot; to be the nexus of an entire enterprise_#x27;s integrations. In short, CloudHub is where modern enterprises run their integration glue.
And that_#x27;s why MuleSoft has incredible momentum with some of the biggest companies in the world.<p>Where do you come in?<p>First, MuleSoft is investing heavily in our CloudHub platform. Since it_#x27;s a new product, there_#x27;s very little legacy; and since we_#x27;re still a startup, you get to be a big part of a small team with a very broad impact. This is not a place to rest on your laurels: this is a place to make your mark on the world.<p>Second, you get to work on great technologies: single-page Ajax apps; client-side MVC using backbone.js building on RESTful back-end APIs; Twitter bootstrap and jQuery; LESS; grunt; node.js, of course; perhaps you_#x27;ll bring in some other new technology to the stack.<p>Finally, and maybe the coolest part: since Mule already has the world_#x27;s biggest companies on board, CloudHub will have the backing of the biggest customers to drive adoption of standards, technologies, coding paradigms, etc. So this stuff is poised to make a huge impact.<p>And you? You already know you can create killer UI_#x27;s based on the work of designers and your own creativity; and it_#x27;s a given that you_#x27;re a master of all things HTML5_#x2F;CSS3_#x2F;JavaScript. But isn_#x27;t it time you turned your attention to a really, really big problem?<p>Click here if you_#x27;re interested

We take raw data about Movies, Music, Sports, Economics, Politics and more and make it possible for regular people to analyze and extract useful information from it. We also enable them to browse, share and discuss the fascinating insights they discover using our tools with one another.<p>While there are mountains of raw data out there, only scientists and programmers can currently make any real use of it. Our mission is to make that data accessible and useful to everyone.<p>Our team has extensive experience working with large, complex data problems and in building and nurturing online communities.We are currently a team of 4 people, and are looking to add 2 more talented individuals to the mix soon.<p>1) FE Engineer: You have a great design sense and some serious engineering skills. You think the famous quote, _quot;there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things_quot; is spot on. Whenever you_#x27;re browsing the web, you_#x27;re constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved. You_#x27;re a pragmatist who_#x27;s ok with ignoring IE6 users. You_#x27;ve built complex, popular web-based applications before. You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead. Our FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css. Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required. Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.<p>2) Head of Marketing _amp; Business Development: You_#x27;re a natural born deal maker. When you throw a party, too many people show up. You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you. You believe product design and marketing are one and the same. You_#x27;re ready to join an extremely talented product _amp; engineering team and show them that everything they thought they knew about how to really promote and grow a new site from the ground-up is wrong.<p>If you fit the bill for either of these positions, and you think what we_#x27;re working on sounds intriguing, then we_#x27;d love to hear from you at jobs@iknow.io.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>NODE.JS — BERLIN — VERSUS.COM<p>Top 5 reasons why you should move to Berlin, now:<p>1. Lowest livings costs with highest standard of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun + we have Car2Go and Drive-Now (these are world_#x27;s best smartphone-supported car sharing systems with brand new cars at every corner, cheaper than owning a car or riding a cab). In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension.<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Earlybird, Mozilla and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English. Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one.<p>5. Berlin_#x27;s night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.<p>Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, we’d love to talk with you.

It_#x27;s pretty amazing.<p>We have thousands of customers including many companies you know and love.  We_#x27;re generating significant revenue and growing our team swiftly with folks from Google, Stanford, Accenture Tech Labs, and Tubemogul.<p>We_#x27;re up against companies 10x our size, and winning regularly because our product is awesome and our customers understand how much we love working on it.<p>Underneath our simple self-service dashboard is a massive beast of a real-time bidding platform that processes billions and billions of ad requests a day.  We_#x27;re looking for an engineer to tame this beast using common sense and lots and lots of automation.  If you like using tools like Scout, Nagios, and Jenkins and want to do something really, really hard, this might be a good fit for you!<p>We_#x27;re backed by A-list investors.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>New York, NY - Full-time and_#x2F;or intern - Pathgather (pathgather.com)<p>Pathgather is bringing the open online education revolution to the corporate world. We_#x27;re disrupting a $2bn industry with a 50% dissatisfaction rate through a platform that allows employees to learn more by learning together. Our platform incorporates educational resources from across the web (think MOOCs and the like) with a company_#x27;s own internal content to provide employees with a comprehensive learning catalogue. Add a social layer on top of that, and we_#x27;re building the next gen of LMS (learning management systems).<p>We_#x27;re bootstrapping and have already signed a Fortune 200 company with 30,000+ employees as our first customer. They signed on board before we even had the product finished, which shows the demand for this type of platform!<p>We_#x27;re a team of 2 at the moment (the founders) and are offering excellent pay and equity for our first engineering, full-time hire (full stack engineer is a huge plus). Any hire will be core to influencing the direction of our product and business. Cultural fit is highest priority. We work in WeWork in NYC and are looking for someone who we_#x27;ll enjoy hanging out with as much as working with. Skills in any of the following are a plus, but seeing as how we are education based, if you aren_#x27;t fully versed in all of these, no worries. Come learn here!<p>* Rails<p>* AngularJS (we use it heavily!)<p>* PostgreSQL<p>* Phonegap_#x2F;Mobile development<p>* Coffeescript_#x2F;Sass_#x2F;Haml<p>* Past experience in API development<p>To apply, email me your Github or links to past work at jamie@pathgather.com.

Our mission is to collect, organize and make sense of all human health data.<p>We started this company in late March this year, and are currently hard at work building the infrastructure to pull in and analyze health data from a wide variety of sources. Some of these include: wearable sensors, consumer health devices, smartphones, and genetic testing services (like 23_amp;Me).

You have experience shipping real products to users. You are broadly curious, have probably had some side projects, and you have ideally hacked around with some hardware as well.<p>You are versatile across technologies and platforms, and can teach yourself what you don_#x27;t know quickly. You don_#x27;t identify with specific technologies as much as you identify with the problems that need to be solved.<p>Ideally, though not required, you have some experience with distributed database systems (cassandra, hadoop, hbase, etc.), security (HIPAA), and generally get excited about data, sensors, health, and how we can combine them to make people healthy at scale.<p>We are based in Palo Alto, California - the right candidate can work remotely for a time period, though we would like to get the whole team under the same roof soon.<p>Come help us build the human health data infrastructure layer.<p>andrei@humanapi.co</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6143099_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%54%46%33%34%78%39%45%4a%33%70%71%58%4d%61%61%49%64%58%4f%54%73%38">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6141353 href="vote?for=6141353_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%54%46%33%34%78%39%45%4a%33%70%71%58%4d%61%61%49%64%58%4f%54%73%38"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6141353></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=vide0star">vide0star</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6141353">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;re a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over £350 million of bets since launching in 2010. Smarkets has been featured in publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.<p>We_#x27;re building a reliable, low-latency exchange system to facilitate automated traded strategies, as well as a fast, modern web interface. Our team constantly works on significant, challenging software engineering problems; if you_#x27;re fed up of writing yet another boring CMS, we might be able to help.<p>The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques and REST. We make extensive use of version control, configuration management and automated testing, which allows us to reliably deploy code to production several times a day.<p>Our team builds on a modern, open-source software stack which includes Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, Graphite, Chef and Git.<p>For more info: <a href="http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;info.smarkets.com_#x2F;about_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;</a></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6141353_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%54%46%33%34%78%39%45%4a%33%70%71%58%4d%61%61%49%64%58%4f%54%73%38">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6141957 href="vote?for=6141957_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%54%46%33%34%78%39%45%4a%33%70%71%58%4d%61%61%49%64%58%4f%54%73%38"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6141957></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=seanmccann">seanmccann</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6141957">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco<p>Intrans<p>Ruby Engineers, Mobile Engineer, interns<p>The last 50 years has seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world_#x27;s first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it_#x27;s hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry. We are changing that.<p>Come join our growing team in San Francisco and help change this massive industry for the better!

Solum is a venture-backed start-up headquartered in the SOMA district of San Francisco.

Our team of 25 people are experts from a broad set of disciplines -- software development, data science, chemistry, physics, agronomy, and business.<p>Since the introduction of precision farming technology and techniques over 15 years ago, advanced growers and their advisors have generated significant volumes of geospatial data about their soils, crops and yields. However, the current industry desktop software packages make it difficult to manage this data and turn it into actionable information. Solum is developing a cloud and mobile-first software platform that will greatly simplify the transport, storage, analysis, and sharing of precision agriculture data. Solum_#x27;s intuitive interface gives crop advisors and growers access to the information they need to make critical agronomy and farm management decisions in the field.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6144737_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%54%46%33%34%78%39%45%4a%33%70%71%58%4d%61%61%49%64%58%4f%54%73%38">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6144805 href="vote?for=6144805_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%54%46%33%34%78%39%45%4a%33%70%71%58%4d%61%61%49%64%58%4f%54%73%38"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6144805></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=o0-0o">o0-0o</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6144805">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA - Full-time, permanent - MuleSoft<p>Node.js Developer<p>Mulesoft is looking for node.js Developers to join our award winning Cloud Platforms team in San Francisco.<p>You will get to pioneer a greenfield JavaScript_#x2F;Node.js project with a growing team creating brand new services and features for our CloudHub Platform - our Integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) which recently won the SIIA Software CODiE Award for Best Integration Solution.
You will have the opportunity to apply node.js to develop high-performance and highly-scalable event-driven components which will provide the backbone for the CloudHub platform, and a set of shared services across the Anypoint cloud platform. This is a greenfield project so there is tons of room for you to be creative, solve impossible problems, try new technologies and make your personal mark on things. In addition you have the opportunity, client-side, to use JavaScript and frameworks like Ember and Angular for developing Single Page Applications.<p>You’ll get to work with a great team of smart and talented engineers in San Francisco, as well as plenty of opportunity to travel to our engineering team in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We have a really nice office space with lots of company perks, and we run regular meetups and hackathons. Most importantly you’ll have a lot of fun doing this.<p>Some of the things that would make you a great fit for this exciting role:
You are excited about node.js and could explain to a room full of engineers why it’s such a compelling and powerful technology.
You are active in the open source community. You have a github account and would be happy to share with us some of the projects you have started or contributed to. MuleSoft is an open source company and most of our team are open source contributors.
You are constantly trying out new languages and frameworks on your own time - Ruby, Scala, Clojure, Akka, Angular, Ember, etc.
You are interested in APIs, big integration and big data challenges. A lot of what we are building involves scaling to massive volumes of web transactions and analytics_#x2F;metrics which will require technologies like AWS, Hadoop, and real-time event processing.
Strong JavaScript knowledge and development best practices including unit testing and continuous integration of JS applications. You should feel passionate about this and have pretty strong opinions on why it is so important.
You probably have a Web_#x2F;UI JavaScript background and are comfortable working up and down the full stack and contributing to our SPA if needed (in fact this is probably one of the reasons you are excited about node.js).
You know when to choose appropriate technologies for the team to use; iterate quickly on ideas and push them out to customers in a continuous fashion; assist junior members of the team by performing code reviews and providing technical advice.
Multiple openings at various levels (junior, senior, principal).<p>Click here if you_#x27;re interested in learning more:

We focus on technology, but are problem solvers before anything else. Depending on your interests and skills, you may work on one of our products (like devo.ps) or with our partners at Wiredcraft, building solutions for the World Bank, the UN, CNN or MTV.<p>Either way you will be challenged on a day-to-day basis, working with cutting edge technology within a great team. All of that out of our awesome Shanghai office (yes, in China).<p>What we_#x27;d like you to have?<p>- Serious programming skills. We_#x27;re not focused on one technology in particular (we can train you), but be prepared for a    lot of Javascript: node.js, express.js, backbone.js, marionette.js...<p>- Passion for learning and shipping. We constantly challenge our own positions on development and spend a good deal on experimenting with new things, but at the end of the day we focus on shipping. We apply our own flavor of scrum and encourage high participation and collaboration.<p>- We could go on and on about all kinds of other traits that job ads usually mention (_quot;attention to detail_quot;, _quot;team player_quot;...), but we_#x27;re convinced that if you_#x27;re good at what you do and love practicing your craft these are more or less incidental.<p>- Bonus points if you have experience with Open Source, UI and UX, data visualization, DevOps, performance or scalability.<p>Why would you want to join our team?<p>- You_#x27;ll have great colleagues and work out of an awesome office in downtown Shanghai,
- You_#x27;ll learn a ton, working with great technology on challenging projects,
    * We_#x27;ll make sure you have the right tools and throw in a few perks:
    * A Macbook Air and additional displays,
    * A Ergohuman chair (or an exercise ball if that_#x27;s your thing),
    * Flexible hours (and no overtime),
    * Free snacks and drinks,
    * Weekly team lunch and monthly team dinner,

  + Experience with open source database technologies in production environments
  + Familiarity with MongoDB_#x2F;Redis

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Full-stack dev co-founder for web-service infrastructure startup -- SFBay, possibly remote initially. H1B-okay<p>Looking for a technical co-founder to join technical founder in an
ambitious startup that aims to solve a widespread pain point in
business-consumer interaction.<p>This isn_#x27;t a todo or photo-sharing app. If successful it will be an
important part of web infrastructure that many people use but hardly
think about. No hype, no quirkiness, no ego.<p>It has a sane business model that doesn_#x27;t depend on advertising or
acquisition.<p>Once established it will exhibit a moat that will make competition
very difficult.<p>You must:<p>- be proficient with full-stack web development and have demonstrable experience through work products<p>- be driven, gritty, hard-nosed, goal focused<p>- be very intelligent (preferably with credentials)<p>- have shown that you can transfer your problem solving ability to different fields (accomplished background_#x2F;education in another field like physics, biology, philosophy? Write about topics outside CS_#x2F;Eng_#x2F;tech? Solved problems in another field?)<p>- get things done<p>- be technically talented in general<p>- be self-directed and self-sufficient<p>- be able to find out what needs to be done, what tools are needed and
  learn how to use those tools.<p>- be able to take ownership of nearly all the technical stack of a typical web service<p>- be able to communicate effectively: be articulate, sometimes have strong opinions and be able to defend them without being dogmatic.<p>- be critical: You shouldn_#x27;t believe the hype or be a conformist. You
  should be able to analyze issues independently and come to your own
  conclusions. You should have some justifiable convictions that are
  not in line with popular sentiment.<p>- be thoughtful: You should often think about how to make things
  better, what things are broken, how things fit into the bigger
  picture and about things happening in the world.<p>- Knowledge of web security and how to apply cryptography a plus.<p>Open to existing 2-3 person teams also.
Open to recent graduates, grad school dropouts and those with experience.<p>When responding please enclose a link or attachment to relevant work
product samples along with a short resume and short introductory
letter.<p>No contractors.<p>fullstackcofounder@gmail.com</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6140685_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%43%55%76%5a%46%59%4c%56%47%77%6d%36%55%42%54%55%6e%58%36%52%67%50">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6141392 href="vote?for=6141392_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%43%55%76%5a%46%59%4c%56%47%77%6d%36%55%42%54%55%6e%58%36%52%67%50"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6141392></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=vladimirralev">vladimirralev</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6141392">link</a></span></div><br>

A problem with scale. Insurance is a $2 trillion industry. That’s 36 times larger than Google and Facebook combined. Insurers pay their aging sales force a mint to sell insurance the old-fashioned way (with paper, face-to-face). We’re going to change this.<p>A problem that’s socially important. Nobody’s helping people figure out insurance – and that’s bad. Under-insured medical problems contribute to over half of all personal bankruptcies and home foreclosures. We’re going to deliver social impact.<p>A problem in desperate need of a new approach. The consumer problem in insurance is deceptively simple: insurance is hard to sell because people don’t want to think about bad things like death and illness. Insurers just throw money at the problem: advertising, hefty commissions, pushy sales agents. We’re introducing a new approach.<p>We’re looking to build our team with people who understand the importance of what we’re doing and want to apply their talent and energy to solving a Big Problem.

SocialChorus         
www.SocialChorus.com
-----------------------------------------------<p>You:
You are a Senior Software Developer interested in Ruby and JavaScript, who enjoys being challenged daily and always wants to improve your programming skills. You do agile (concentration in Extreme Programming), test-driven, and pair programming to ensure you find great solutions quickly.<p>The Position:
Our stack consists of two user-facing Rails applications with Backbone on the client. We also have a series of services written in both node.js and pure Ruby. This means our days are a combination of green-field work and legacy code refactoring. A lot of our challenges are around managing the asynchronicity of service-oriented architecture and we are starting to have opinions about how to make that easier, as well as the young gems to support those opinions: <a href="https://github.com/socialchorus/cumuli" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;github.com_#x2F;socialchorus_#x2F;cumuli</a>, <a href="https://github.com/socialchorus/superbolt" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;github.com_#x2F;socialchorus_#x2F;superbolt</a>. We’re also starting to tackle our big data problem and our design is moving more and more toward the hexagonal side of Rails.<p>Us:
At SocialChorus, we want to invest in our devs and give them the opportunity to become stronger by offering them courses, taking them to conferences (in _amp; out of the Bay Area), and bringing in industry gurus, like Sandi Metz, to mentor the team.<p>We believe that people should be dedicated to their jobs, but also lead a balanced work_#x2F;personal life. Our development environment is casual, flexible and full of people who are passionate about their job. The office is located on one of the busiest streets in San Francisco, allowing access to various cafes and places to grab a bite. We also have a stocked fridge and a never ending shelf of snacks, so you will not go hungry.<p>Perks:
Other than having all the fun stuff that a start up has, we also offer great benefit packages. This is a full-time, salaried position offering stock options, paid vacation, and benefits: medical, dental and 401k. The position is located onsite at our office in San Francisco, CA. We actively promote diversity and encourage all qualified candidates to apply.<p>If this sounds like your type of job and SocialChorus is the next place you want to work, please send us an email at alexandra@socialchorus.com</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6143730_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%44%62%53%78%47%53%70%71%32%7a%43%73%73%31%66%4a%38%4f%64%30%4a%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6140164 href="vote?for=6140164_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%44%62%53%78%47%53%70%71%32%7a%43%73%73%31%66%4a%38%4f%64%30%4a%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6140164></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pandakar">pandakar</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6140164">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>A couple recommendations:<p>- _quot;2-5 years experience Java_quot; - There are vastly different ways to use Java, so someone like me would be in the 2-5 years of equivalent experience for things like Android, Swing or JavaFX development.  JavaEE has progressed immensely and while the cool kids aren_#x27;t using it, annotation-based development has led to the same sort of _quot;convention-over-configuration_quot; style programming and a lot of code generation from a fairly small amount of code.  You don_#x27;t have to generate 10 classes and interfaces for each EntityBean (EJB1 and EJB2) anymore.<p>- _quot;... tools like Ant_quot; - Managing dependencies in Java can be a real headache, so you want to specify a tool-chain that has dependency management.  Say something like _quot;Ant+Ivy_quot; or _quot;Maven_quot;.  For integration with Hudson_#x2F;Jenkins, Maven is superior but either will work.<p>- _quot;OO Architecture_quot; needs to be melded with an MVC_#x2F;MVP pattern for big projects.  These architectural patterns help immensely with testing and code management (plus watch for package tangle in Sonar).<p>- What_#x27;s the rest of your tool-chain?  You left a lot of holes and it_#x27;s not clear from your ad which technologies you use and which you <i>want</i> to use.  For comparison, here is my toolchain (I could give you more detail but not here):<p><pre><code>  - JavaEE
  - WildFly
  - PostgreSQL
  - CouchDB
  - Maven
  - Jenkins
  - Sonar
  - Nexus
  - Vagrant
  - Ansible
  - JUnit and plugins (XmlUnit, DBUnit, etc)
  - Selenium2 (on the grid server and managed by Jenkins)
</code></pre>
- _quot;Amazon experience_quot; is not very specific.  I think we_#x27;ll all assume you mean AWS, but there are APIs for running shops and for using mechanical turk.<p>Hope this helps!</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6144438_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%44%62%53%78%47%53%70%71%32%7a%43%73%73%31%66%4a%38%4f%64%30%4a%37">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6150831 href="vote?for=6150831_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%44%62%53%78%47%53%70%71%32%7a%43%73%73%31%66%4a%38%4f%64%30%4a%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6150831></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=guilhermekfe">guilhermekfe</a> 2 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6150831">link</a></span></div><br>
