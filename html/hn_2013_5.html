<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>So, uh, I'm looking for an entry-level sysadmin/data-center monkey.  You could call this an intern type position, but I don't care if you are in school or not.<p>Prgmr.com rents virtual private servers, dedicated servers, and datacenter space.  Right now, we have 3 full-time folks, counting me, and two part-timers but I'm the only hardware person, and only two of us are local.<p>So, there are several catches.  the first?  I can't afford a full time person for at least two months.   If you are willing to show up and work between then and now?  $15/hr on a 1099.  After those two months (and after I'm done paying for twice the co-lo I need)  we can talk about going full time W2.  (prgmr.com pays for Kaiser, if you are full-time)<p>Now, I do have an arrangement with a local refurbished server and network hardware dealer;  I give him a good entry level person, he'll hire them full time with health insurance and stuff (for a little more than I'm paying;  not a lot more, this is definitely still entry-level pay.)  and he'll rent you back to me on a per-day basis at a discount (sort of as a referral bonus to me.)   - so that's one way you can make this full-time before I stabilize prgmr.com.   Note, he's based out of mountain view, and I'm in Santa Clara and all of this is very much hands-on work.<p>So yeah, what I need is someone I can teach how to handle my layer-1.   I need my shit wired up, I need it wired up neatly (I can train you in cable lacing, but the neater you are, the better.)   I need all my ports labeled inside my network gear (I can show you how to do this; Serial ain't rocket science.)  and inside my PDUs.<p>This would be pretty good for someone studying up on their CCNA or something;  I probably have obsolete hardware I could give you for your lab, too.<p>I need someone I can train up to set up my IPMI out of band access.  Again, I can train, it's not hard.    Again, experience using the command line helps a lot.<p>I also need someone who can handle racking/stacking servers, dragging servers to the car and back.  You need to be able to safely lift 50lbs, (and more importantly, you need to ask for help when you /can't/ lift safely.  pester the security guys;  they will usually help, and if not, call me.)  and you need transportation that can handle 50lb servers.  (meh, if you have transportation, we can probably work something out with the hauling.  I've got an old van I loan people.)<p>You need to be able to handle ssh, and ssh with public key authentication with minimal help from me.<p>So, the way I usually do this is that people email me, we go back and forth a few times (I won't hire you if you can't communicate via email... sorry, just one of my things.)  then next time I need help I call you up.   You show up and work.  I pay you (check, but if you want we can drop by the bank and get it cashed for you same day... just when I pay cash the accountant gets mad at me)   If you do well and I need help again, i call you back;   At these rates, (and especially with this (lack of) stability) it's not fair to expect you to interview for free.<p>So yeah.  Entry level.    If you seem teachable, I don't care if you are currently unemployed.<p>I demand honesty, but not loyalty;  by that, I mean I'm realistic. I'm not going to be angry if you move on to a better paying job quickly.<p>Especially at first, while we're just doing 'as needed' gigs?  I'm understanding about your schedule;  I don't demand you drop everything for me.  (Once you go full time, we'll have to talk more about this.   I do eventually want someone besides me to be hardware on-call, but I understand that needs to be worth your time, and this offer probably is probably not good enough to get you to let me drag your ass out of bed at 2am.)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5640648 href="vote?for=5640648_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%36%33%37%36%36%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5640648></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=loungin">loungin</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5640648">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>well, it's a trade-off with the money, usually.    That, and ISPs/hosting companies have traditionally been good places for entry-level folk.  There is a strong culture or tradition of mentorship, or at least, of hiring likely looking folk and letting them run systems above their pay grade.  (and to be clear, this will be a lot of that, too;  I mean, I don't expect you to know this stuff off the bat, and I expect some questions, but I also expect a certain level of ability to, you know, look it up and figure it out.)<p>Locally? I hear that he.net also hires new people and trains; they even have a semi-formal training program.  Some of it is public, too. Check out their IPv6 certification.[1]  - but from what I hear, they have a lot more of that sort of thing internally.   They took my last PFY;  I likely would have been able to keep her if I had extended a full-time offer sooner, as they didn't offer great money, but like I said, I've got two more months of being financially very uncomfortable.<p>[1]<a href="http://ipv6.he.net/certification/" rel="nofollow">http://ipv6.he.net/certification/</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5642290 href="vote?for=5642290_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%36%33%37%36%36%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5642290></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=notJim">notJim</a> 157 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5642290">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Buffer (<a href="http://bufferapp.com" rel="nofollow">http://bufferapp.com</a>) - Anywhere in the world (we're a distributed team of 11 people across the US, UK, Hong Kong and Sydney).<p>I'd love for you to come join Buffer for the fun ride. We have over 650,000 users and are on a $1.3m+ annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead, as we are looking to pass a million users in 2013. We are expecting even faster growth in the coming months through our mobile efforts.<p>We need help on 2 areas right now:<p>1. Android:<p><pre><code>    - Android is our second highest source of signups for Buffer, only
      trailing behind Web which was our original platform.
    - our users love the app, which has a 4.3 rating on Google Play.
    - the app has 100k+ total downloads and 3k daily active users.
    - we work with Google Play, Kindle and Blackberry stores.
</code></pre>
2. Full stack:<p><pre><code>    - we get 1,500-2,000 signups per day on the web
    - we have 160,000 weekly active users for our Chrome extension
    - 4,500 API clients. Most popular: Feedly, IFTTT, Pocket, Instapaper
    - we ship to production multiple times a day
    - we have a data-driven process, with Einstein, our custom
      built a/b testing framework
    - ideally, experience in: PHP (Codeigniter)/Python, MongoDB,
      Backbone.js Javascript, CSS, HTML

</code></pre>
We're a small team of driven hackers and happiness heroes (our support people). Just like you, we're excited and passionate about engineering challenges and have some interesting architecture and scaling problems we work on.<p>If you're interested in coming on board, you will:<p><pre><code>    - work closely myself on Product and Sunil on technical
      architecture
    - ship to thousands of users and iterate quickly
    - work with our metrics team to make smart changes
    - be friendly and comfortable talking directly to customers
      on issues and features
    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great
      approach in dealing with others
    - be a Buffer user (would be awesome, it’s cool if not)
    - be anywhere in the world, and if you'd like, you have help and
      support from us to move to where you want to be
    - have experience working with another startup before (would
      be awesome, it’s cool if not)
</code></pre>
Some aspects of Buffer culture that makes us a little different:<p><pre><code>    - we are totally transparent. We raised $450k, we currently
      have 650k users and generate $110k/mo. Ask me anything else!
    - within the company, all salaries and equity are open and we
      have a formula for the distribution.
    - we're all very focused on self improvement - we have daily
      standups where we discuss our current improvements. This
      could be waking up earlier, starting public speaking, blogging,
      exercise, learning a language, etc.
    - culture deck: http://www.slideshare.net/joelg2/buffer-culture-01-16707113
</code></pre>
Salary: 88k-110k depending on location (living costs) and experience.<p>Equity: 0.5-1%<p>If this sounds fun, let's chat.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Right, but if they don't produce more than the "normal Wichita salary" then you probably shouldn't hire them.  If they produce enough value to be worth $150,000 per year let's say, then you pay them that.  If they don't, you shouldn't pay them that much whether they live in SF or Detroit.<p>If they do produce enough to be worth $150,000, why pay them less just because they live in Wichita?  Supply and demand, sure, but it just seems odd to me to explicitly say that you're paying less if someone lives outside of a major metropolitan area.  I prefer to be (or think that I am) paid based on the value I produce (value pricing) rather than what it costs to keep a roof over my head (cost pricing).  Whether or not this is the case also influences my understanding of how a company thinks about me.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5642674 href="vote?for=5642674_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%36%33%37%36%36%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5642674></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kroy">kroy</a> 157 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5642674">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michigan<p><a href="http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/</a><p>---------------------------------------<p>We are a small team of software craftsmen (10 of us right now) passionate about making people's lives better through software.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US
  
  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we're more concerned with using the 
    right tool for the job. In the past two months, I've worked with Objective-C,
    Javascript (Backbone+PhoneGap), and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives, activities, 
    and families outside of work. Late nights and _#62; 40 hour weeks are rare by design.
  
  - We're agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health/vision/dental insurance, 401(k) + match, 
    quarterly profit sharing, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office with
    snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago, 2.5 hours from Detroit, and less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in the
    Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43
  
  - Affordable housing. If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the 
    Bay Area or NYC, you can afford a house here (or a much nicer rental). I bought 
    a nice house with a mortgage payment drastically lower than the rent of my 
    1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing economy driven by technology, healthcare, and a growing list of startups. 
    The energy here around the growth in technology and the support for entrepreneurs 
    is infectious.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.
  
  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.
</code></pre>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>In a consulting business, the typical way you make money is by selling time. A friend of mine has called this "Slavery to the Tyranny of the Billable Hour". The way to scale is by acquiring more time (aka more employees available to work for more hours) so you can bill more hours. It's ok for some, but diversification is better.<p>We've discovered that whenever you get a bunch of smart folk together who are passionate about what they do, other avenues open up. In our case, we've start forming teams around different business models and product ideas that attract us. These models and ideas are then selectively sponsored by the consultancy to go forward, develop something and release it to the world. The hope is that these new products and businesses would become a source of income for the whole team. As those products and new businesses scale, the consulting business profits, thus scaling through alternate means.<p>Full disclosure: I work with EJ at Mutually Human.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5637912 href="vote?for=5637912_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%36%33%37%36%36%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5637912></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=andrewcooke">andrewcooke</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5637912">link</a></span></div><br>

And any other business that puts an open port between itself and the big bad world.<p>Matasano is looking for appsec consultants, now and forever. What does that mean?<p>We dig deep. Our consultants spend their days sliding up and down the ladder of abstraction, rapidly assimilating unfamiliar systems (and then breaking them). One week you're pulling apart macros in a Lisp app; the next, you're on your hands and knees crawling through x86 disassembly.<p>We move fast. Our projects run on tight deadlines: one or two weeks is typical. Recently we wrote a bespoke proxy to rip apart a custom encrypted protocol, tamper with messages, and cobble it back together again. That could be a two-week job in itself. At Matasano, that's just Tuesday.<p>We find bugs. Not just in applications, but in the tools they're built with. That includes some of the biggest open-source and proprietary software stacks in the world.<p>This is the <i>Mission: Impossible</i> of software gigs, and we need the best people to get the job done. NO PRIOR APPSEC EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. We need great software developers and fast learners, for we intend to go in harm's way. If this sounds interesting to you, we should absolutely talk.<p>Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of software applications?<p><i>Matasano knows.</i><p>Full benefits. Free books. Really smart coworkers. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.matasano.com/careers" rel="nofollow">http://www.matasano.com/careers</a>.<p>Looking for a taste of what we do?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Onespacemedia - Cambridge, UK.
<a href="http://www.onespacemedia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.onespacemedia.com/</a><p>---<p>Junior/middle-weight web developer<p>Are you an internet-obsessed design-savvy coder? Interested in being part of a friendly, dynamic team in a central Cambridge studio? We want to talk to front or back end developers who are creative, organised and love all things web. Ideally you'll have some or all of the following skills:<p>Knowledge of writing standards-compliant, high-performing HTML5 and CSS web pages.
Experience of working with popular web libraries.
We use Django and jQuery, but you can learn these on the job.
Good knowledge of at least one programming language.
We work primarily in Python and Javascript, but are happy for you to learn these on the job too.
An understanding of database programming and design. Familiarity with *nix based operating systems.
Awareness of popular web APIs, such as Google Maps, Twitter and Facebook.
More important than relevant experience is the drive to learn and expand your skill set. If you've got a commitment to excellence and can demonstrate an aptitude for programming then we want to hear from you. In return you'll receive a competitive salary, full training and your own top of the range laptop (we work predominantly on Macs but we can let the odd Windows machine slip through the net!).<p>What you can expect to work on<p>Expect to work on a wide range of challenging projects. We don't have a cookie cutter approach to the web and push the design and technical envelope on all our work. Recent projects have included: an application that manages, filters and analyses radio spectrum data from a series of nationally-located nodes; a responsive website for a high-end safari and Africa travel company; a large website and online admin system to manage the ever-changing attractions and events for an interactive science centre; and a website/application that tracks, maps and graphs the progress of University spin-out companies. Most of our projects are responsive and we're as committed to the front-end user experience as we are to what's happening under the hood.<p>How we work<p>As a team we listen, learn, plan, design, build, test and deliver together. Whilst different people are responsible for their own part of a project, we all understand the importance of the chain and support each other to get things done. You'll be expected to manage your own workload and you won't ever have a project manager breathing down your neck. Our process is front-loaded with in-depth research and discovery rounds in which both developers and designers participate. This keeps scope creep to a minimum and deadlines and budgets realistic. We don't subscribe to unnecessary bureacracy and keep things streamlined and agile. You'll get to talk to clients too - we all share the successes and the challenges of a project together.<p>Learning<p>The web is constantly evolving so we expect you to as well. Experimentation and learning new skills is part of the fabric at Onespacemedia. Need some books or course materials? No problem. Want to try out some new techniques on a test project? No problem. Something you want to tell the world about a technology or trend? Blog about it on the website. We expect our team members to be passionate and knowledgeable about their field of expertise.<p>Lifestyle<p>Working at Onespacemedia is fun. We do serious work for serious clients but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy it. Expect plenty of laughter, music, company lunches, trips to the pub and impromptu ping pong battles. Just ten minutes walk from the station and ten minutes walk from the centre of Cambridge, the office is located just of Mill Road, the cultural heart of Cambridge (and probably the closest thing you can get to a London street outside of the capital). We're surrounded by green spaces, pubs, shops and cafés (including the legendary Hot Numbers). We've even got parking spaces. We operate a flexitime scheme too so those of you who are commuting from out of town don't have to spend four hours a day stuck in a traffic jam to and from work.<p>How to apply<p>Please send CV, covering note and links to any websites or applications you have created, or been involved with, to jobs@onespacemedia.com. We are open to enquiries from individuals seeking part-time and full-time work.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5639082 href="vote?for=5639082_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%36%33%37%36%36%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5639082></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=lutorm">lutorm</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5639082">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think what is being discussed is a TN Visa for Canadian citizens. Generally, it is very easy for any Canadian to come work in the U.S. as they just need to go to the boarder to have some paperwork signed off for their TN Visa. But, the problem with SpaceX is that we have to follow ITAR Regulations and can only employ permanent residents (U.S. Citizens and Green Card Holders).  TN Visa Holders unfortunately do not fall within either of those groups. If anyone is interested in working at SpaceX, then definitely apply or contact me.

He was ready to buy three Russian ICBMs for $21 million when the Russians told him that no, they meant $21 million for one. "They taunted him," Cantrell says. "They said, 'Oh, little boy, you don't have the money?' I said, 'Well, that's that.' I was sitting behind him on the flight back to London when he looked at me over the seat and said, 'I think we can build a rocket ourselves.'"

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>New York / London - Bloomberg<p><a href="http://jobs.bloomberg.com/" rel="nofollow">http://jobs.bloomberg.com/</a> <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/ux" rel="nofollow">http://www.bloomberg.com/ux</a><p>There are many jobs open at Bloomberg, but I'm particularly looking for intelligent software engineers and UX professionals to work under the CTO and Infrastructure team in R_#38;D. We have roughly 4,000 R_#38;D employees, so work is very diverse across the company. Teams are roughly 4-8 people at the lowest level and group up into larger organizations organized by product type (equities, fixed income, etc.). I happen to work on infrastructure for the Professional service (aka Terminal). Our team has very little interaction with anything finance related and most of our work is related to evolving the entire platform forward and making forward-looking changes. Back in 2005, we converted all of our higher-level "app" development to server-side JS (custom, Spidermonkey based) and now run probably the largest server-side JS stack in the world (~20MM LOC). We migrated a lot of our GUI toolkit to be scripted as well (LUA this time) to allow us to more easily evolve it. And now we're evolving it, embedding WebKit and pushing bugfixes and feature enhancements to do what we need (our fork is on GH). We're helping define and implement CSS3 Grid spec and help implement ES6 generators among other things. We built and run a third-party app store within the Terminal. Over the past decade we've rebuilt the C++ foundation of the company from the ground up, starting with our own STL implementation using the Lakos allocator model (Lakos and a few other C++ committee members work here). We have a huge wealth of awesome C++ libraries that we started open-sourcing and will continue to add more layers as time goes by.<p>All of what I mentioned above is stuff done by the infrastructure team, and we're a tiny percentage of the overall R_#38;D population. Other teams get to do fun stuff as well. The mortgage team ported long-running ABS OAS calculations from Linux farms to GPU clusters and wrote a Python based cash flow engine from the ground up, potentially helping define the SEC's Python-files-must-be-included rules.<p>We run a worldwide network with somewhere around 35,000 circuits in 180+ countries. We ingest anywhere from 45-60 billion "ticks" daily aggregate from feeds in all of these countries. We normalize, scrub, and then re-distribute all this data to customers in all of those countries in an efficient manner. The Terminal provides analytic and visualization tools to work with market data, as well as the same tools to work with news and alerts. On the news side, we ingest over 80,000 news feeds (e.g. WSJ would be one "feed") from around the world and do the same kind of processing, applying ML for sentiment and topic classification, etc. We also design our own hardware in-house -- everything from keyboards and monitors, to custom ASICs for authentication/subscription tokens and PCIe hardware security modules for our certificate infrastructure. The web side (bloomberg.com, businessweek.com, BGOV, BLAW, Black, etc) uses mostly Rails stacks and everything you would expect to find in a web shop.<p>Oh, and we have a TV station, radio station, etc. They innovate too. Bloomberg TV is the first non-OTA channel to be distributed via Aereo, for instance :)<p>We could use a motto like "We do a lot of stuff."<p>Contact me if you want to discuss at andrew@ishiboo.com. If you want to chat in person, we are a sustaining sponsor of NYTM and are at all the meetups. and we'll have a few people at JSConf in May.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5638808 href="vote?for=5638808_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%36%33%37%36%36%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5638808></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=arohner">arohner</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5638808">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA. Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day.
We're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:<p>* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)<p>There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href="http://academia.edu/hiring" rel="nofollow">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>. There is more on TechCrunch about our mission here <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/05/the-future-of-peer-review/</a> (The Future of Peer Review) and here <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/</a> (The Future of Science)<p>We want to hire world class engineers.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Amsterdam, Netherlands. Work permit and relocation assistance provided.<p>Hiring for two different companies, both of whom will pay your relocation.<p>Company 1:<p>Looking for UX designers, front-end and back-end developers.
UX designer: use Photoshop, Gimp, or whatever makes your socks roll up and down and you know how to make Web and/or mobile applications work for customers. Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS also needed.<p>Front-end developer: you can make Web sites do exactly what you want them to do, regardless of the browser or operating system the web site is running on. Knowledge of HTML, JavaScript and CSS required.<p>Back-end developers: you know what it takes to power the back-end of large web sites. You understand scalability issues and can explain the difference between an inner and outer join. You know what O(log N) is and why it's important. Your programming language history isn't important because you're good enough to learn a new language if needed.<p>All positions: not looking for rock stars. Looking for competent technical talent who are willing to move to Europe (unless you're already here). We have many expats working here and we'll even help pay for Dutch lessons, if you want them.<p>We also like people who understand business because you'll be expected to make many of your own decisions without having to ask permission from management for every little thing that you do. You will have the power to get stuff done, work with a great bunch of people and be able to spend your five weeks of vacation time cruising across Europe and discovering why Amsterdam is such a beautiful city.<p>Company 2:<p>Unlike Company 1, Company 2 <i>is</i> looking for rock stars to bring to Amsterdam. They want front-end devs and system engineers. They want you to have at least a bachelor's degree in IT or a related field and you have to have a fairly impressive resume/CV (in terms of work, open source or educational background (preferably all three)) to even get an interview. In return, they offer a very agile environment, hard tasks, in a stable, long-term company. Large company, but each team gets a room with only a few people (no open-plan distractions). Management gets out of your way and meetings are discouraged. There's a heavy focus on constant performance optimization of systems because no one like a slow system. Multiple programming languages are used with the language being chosen to fit the problem and not the other way around.<p>Front-end devs: mostly PHP with Smarty and Propel, though other languages, such as Java,  and Python are used. You will be working on desktop, tablet and mobile applications and know Javascript and CSS fluently. This means more than just jQuery! Mobile experience is helpful, as it UX work.<p>System Engineers: you will be responsible for thousands of Linux servers across several data centers. Company 2 serves a quarter of a billion page views a day and heavy use of the latest open-source technologies is encouraged in their quest for better and better performance. Nginx, Puppet, stackless Python and MySQL are just a few of the technologies involved. The engineers are heavily involved in open source and are encouraged to give back to the community. You have deep experience in Linux, preferably multiple distributions, you know bash and at least one scripting language. You have strong experience with a variety of open source monitoring and scalability technologies.<p>To apply for any of these, send an email to jobs at allaroundtheworld.fr and refer to this post.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5639493 href="vote?for=5639493_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%36%33%37%36%36%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5639493></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zukhan">zukhan</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5639493">link</a></span></div><br>

Currently we have a few PhD's, few ex-googler's, some tech book authors, couple of ex-linkedin, ex-microsofties, and stanfords, and a bunch of startup vets like Trulia and dealer.com. Heck we even have the guy who wrote the Java testing framework TestNG ( <a href="http://www.testng.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.testng.org</a> ) and the guy who wrote Mailinator ( <a href="http://mailinator.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://mailinator.blogspot.com</a> ). And we're only up to 7 people. But we want an 8th and maybe a 9th.<p>Job Description: Someone we want to work with. Someone who will make us smarter and better and, in return, someone we can make smarter and better too. Someone who will help us make our company and its products great.<p>Our technology includes: Java. Thousands of threads (Mailinator guy keeps adding more, TestNG guy keeps removing them). Tons of data, tremendous data analysis, fuzzy logic, machine learning, natural language processing. We use Mongo and we're having no problems with it - because we're careful. We treat every superfluous database access and every unnecessary network call like its a small insult to our users. And gosh darn it, we love our users.<p>Simply, we are building a product that fetches and analyzes massive amounts of data to improve our user's lives (see the website for a more specific description, or better yet, email me)<p>Job Requirements: You know Java (or at least you're willing to learn it) - but hands-down you know some computer language cold. You know it well enough to hate parts of it but yet probably understand why they're there. You get why algorithms are important and know when to implement them and sometimes, when its better to just do it the easy way. You understand that startups experiment a lot - and consequently discover amazing things occasionally, but throw away code far more often.<p>The static credentials on your resume are great but honestly, its the dynamic stuff we're more interested in.<p>You've done stuff. You're proud of the stuff you've done. You can show us - heck, you can't wait to show us. It might be an iphone app, or an open source project, or a thread-safe cache-invalidation scheme, or a javascript game, or maybe you launched a startup. Either which way - you built something - start to finish. You can deliver.<p>The interview:<p>We love solving problems and every interview question we ask is based on something we've actually had to code. So we sometimes get rather excited to find a smart person willing to solve a problem a new way with us on a whiteboard. You should think this way too - you don't rate interviews as being easy or hard - you rate them as being boring or fun. And we definitely shoot for fun. Right answers aren't the point - finding a good attack vector on the problem is.<p>Our CTO's take on getting your resume Silicon Valley ready:

As such we have need for:<p>- backend engineers[1]<p>- product engineers[2]<p>We're analytical about the work that we do and you should be too. You should also care about getting things done right, and be pragmatic about when to choose speed over quality, if you opt for the former you're the type of engineer that makes a note that you shorted on quality and you'll come back and fix that up.<p>We keep small engineering teams (usually no more than 10 people per team), this permits us to own what we work on. It is one of the best things about working here in my experience!<p>The low down on the positions:<p>[1] - Backend Engineers<p>With 30m MAU (last published number... it is bigger now!) our backend engineers work to keep our service humming along with five nines of uptime. Your work would include not only improving core pieces of infrastructure but also envisaging new pieces that we do not have yet that will help take us to the next level. Some examples of things that have been done recently:<p>- migration to ruby 1.9<p>- built out a new IRC chat server which handles ~1000 qps. Best thing here is we slotted this in and no one noticed (except that chat was more stable, etc).<p>- Created a brand new API to access our data, this is used by Activision (Call of Duty: Black Ops II), EA (EA origin) and PlanetSide II, Smite, amongst a wide array of other game devs.<p>- Replaced a core piece of infrastructure used to let us know what streams are live, and what content they have on them. Again, this has been done without anyone noticing - its main win was taking us from needing 8 app servers to being able to handle all the load on one, but we run a couple of resilience.. naturally<p>We've a bunch of other coolness in the pipeline.<p>[2] - Product Engineers<p>One of the reasons we're growing so fast is that we're starting to churn out high quality features and general product improvements. There is still so far to go, the twitch you see now is as a result of dedicating much of our engineering work to scaling, in that time we've hired some kick ass product engineers and they're starting to push us forwards.  Some things we've worked on recently:<p>- migrating site over to emberjs<p>- "Turbo" - ad free watching on all channels<p>- key product improvements: vod watching, vod creation<p>- new flash player - faster, less resource intensive, easier to build new features on<p>- payment provider integrations - aiming to make it as easy to pay in various geos as is possible.<p>We've a bunch of other coolness in the pipeline!

We're profitable and at the point where our growth is rapidly accelerating - we've winning tenders left, right and centre and all of our current clients are adding more users and departments to our current deployments.<p>Our current platform is front to back C# - WCF, ASP.NET MVC, WinForms and WPF, with SQLServer on the backend.<p>I'm looking for solid C# and ASP.Net developers from Junior to Senior level, though having specific C# experience is secondary to being willing to learn quickly and being passionate about technology as long as you've got other languages you're strong in.<p>Having experience in DB design and query tuning would be of special interest as we're dealing with high volumes of patient information and 100Gb+ datasets on some of our sites and we want to keep our system running as fast as possible!<p>We're looking to hire several developers, offering between £25k-£50k depending on skill set and experience. If you're interested or you've got any questions, drop me an e-mail at tech.recruitment@dictate.it and I'll do my best to answer anything you ask!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5638973 href="vote?for=5638973_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%36%33%37%36%36%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5638973></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wahnfrieden">wahnfrieden</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5638973">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Canvas Networks - New York, NY - Fulltime, On-site or remote<p>Canvas Networks is looking for an iOS Engineer to join a small, close-knit team building DrawQuest — iPad's premier drawing community. We're venture funded and backed by an incredible group of investors, who include Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Lerer Ventures, SV Angel, Founder Collective, Joshua Schachter, and Chris Dixon.<p>We're investing in mobile and tablet in a big way and are looking for someone to join our iOS engineering efforts. We're a young company with a brand new product, so this is a good opportunity to grow with us as we grow as a company, and a great time to join and make an impact.<p>We're tackling some interesting product and engineering challenges. To help us iterate and sustain momentum, we practice continuous deployment to the extent possible, which demands technical creativity with native Objective-C / Cocoa apps. On our backend servers, we ship upwards of twenty times a day — iOS development makes things more complex but it's an area we're interested in improving.<p>We ask a lot of our developers, but we offer a lot in exchange:<p>* Perks and benefits. Free lunch, an office arcade (3 cabinets!), competitive equity and salary with full benefits (health, dental, vision), take-what-you-need vacation.<p>* A great working environment, including whatever tools you need. Big monitors, the hardware setup you want. Sit-stand desks if you're into that kind of thing.<p>* A voice in product development. Decisions aren't made in a vacuum. Be a key player in building an amazing product.<p>* Transparency into the business. We review financials as a team monthly. Meetings aren't held behind closed doors.<p>Our office is in Union Square, Manhattan.

We’re in search of back-end developers with a passion for solving hard problems with performant code. If you are interested in creating great products, building new features and improving the existing Shopify features, then please apply!<p>Developing Shopify<p>Shopify is the longest continuously developed Rails app on the planet and we care a great deal about code quality. Shopify, in contrast to most other rails shops, always runs on the latest rails version. Many core rails features have been developed within Shopify and have later been added to the Rails framework. We often go back and improve core parts of the Shopify codebase to make it better or more lean. We can do this because we have a positively massive unit test coverage which will immediately sound the alarm when something goes wrong.<p>We ship on quality instead of on time. When a feature is ready we deploy it immediately to everyone or use an internal system to roll it out to a certain percentage of customers. Various teams deploy new code many times throughout the day.<p>Shopify's production scale is massive. We host tens of thousands of online stores and regularly see hundreds of millions of requests a day. When you push out new code tons of people will see what you made within seconds. Operating on this level is hard but incredibly rewarding.<p>Responsibilities:<p>* Write back-end code in Ruby and Go.<p>* Work with a world class design and product team.<p>* Providing beautiful and fast code that improves the code-base of our products in meaningful ways.<p>* Use TDD to write rock-solid code, utilizing our huge test suite to make changes with confidence.<p>* Rapidly fix bugs or take your time to solve hard problems well.<p>* Deploy code to hundreds of servers and tens of thousands of customers in your first week.<p>* Never stop learning. Shopify is an environment of constant personal growth.<p>Qualifications and Desired Skills:<p>* Know Rails or be ready to learn it quickly.<p>* Proficiency with UNIX commands.<p>* Knowledge of relational databases and SQL, we use MySQL.<p>* Strong commitment to quality.<p>* Experience building and scaling user-focused web application.<p>* Being awesome and having a love for Shopify - Major Plus!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5638299 href="vote?for=5638299_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%36%33%37%36%36%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5638299></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=psycr">psycr</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5638299">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>We are looking for a core-team member for our startup in Bangalore, India. We offer good chunk of equity for the right person.<p>Background<p>Gaglers (<a href="http://gaglers.com" rel="nofollow">http://gaglers.com</a>) is a scalable real-time chat platform. Currently, we offer group chat for communities and live chat with unlimited operators.<p>Our high-level technical challenges are,<p><pre><code>    scaling a real-time platform to millions of concurrent users.
    measure all interactions to make data driven decisions
</code></pre>
This is a full-time position based in Bangalore, India.<p>Typical Day at the Job<p>Here is how a typical day will look like. You start by looking the status of the production dashboard and bugs. With a quick scan you find that that the message counts are not getting updated in the dashboard after the code push last night. You jump on it right way and send a short code-review out, after testing it on your staging setup.<p>With that out of the way, you get back to the feature that you have been working on. You know exactly why you are building this feature and what impact it will have on the customers. The feature was specced out last week in some intense design discussions. You finished a quick prototype yesterday. You throw it out today and start the code and unit testing for the initial release. The plan is to deploy a basic version this week sometime, gather feedback over a few days and then fine-tune it based on what the customers say.<p>Just after lunch, while you code, you come across a bug in the queuing sub-system. You decide that it would be simple for you to fix it as well and so you do. While you fixed the bug, you thought about how you can make the queuing system much more scalable. You write a quick note to yourself to talk about it later.<p>By the end of the day you'll have a good chunk of the new feature implemented. You'll send that queuing system bug fix for code-review tomorrow morning and continue your work of the new feature.
How the role will develop<p>Initially, the tasks you take on will be smaller and fairly well defined. Longer term, the requirements you get will be more general, and you’ll interpret them to produce great solutions. You’ll also generate tasks on your own initiative as you identify opportunities.<p>As we grow, we may need to take on more developers. You’ll have the opportunity to be responsible for these folks if you want.<p>Technical Qualifications<p>You will be,<p><pre><code>    fluent in Django and Python and comfortable using Git
    be happy with HTML and Javascript
    have designed and written applications using Django
    comfortable managing a group of remote linux servers.
</code></pre>
You'll have the opportunity to work on all areas of our stack. Our technology stack includes,<p><pre><code>    Django, Python, Erlang
    Redis, MySQL
    RabbitMQ, Celery
    MemCache
    Bootstrap, JQuery, Javascript
</code></pre>
We are looking for someone who sees their role as bigger than just programming. You'll also get to know our business. You'll also look for opportunities to make things cooler for our customers.<p>Contact me directly: augustus at gaglers dot com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5638857 href="vote?for=5638857_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%44%38%6d%54%71%35%74%41%59%44%38%4a%62%6b%61%6e%4c%4e%31%4a%54%6a"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5638857></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ddispaltro">ddispaltro</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5638857">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>BERLIN/GERMANY, NODE.JS, HIGH TRAFFIC SITE<p>Top 5 reasons why you should move to Berlin, now:<p>1. Lowest livings costs with highest standard of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun + we have Car2Go and Drive-Now (these are world's best smartphone-supported car sharing systems with brand new cars at every corner, cheaper than owning a car or riding a cab). In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird, Mozilla and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one.<p>5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.<p>Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, we’d love to talk with you. If you don't live in Berlin yet, we could help to fix that.<p>=_#62; <a href="http://urge.io/jobs" rel="nofollow">http://urge.io/jobs</a><p>If you are doing Node.js or JS, apply today—we are looking for multiple Node.js Software Engineers.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5637902 href="vote?for=5637902_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%44%38%6d%54%71%35%74%41%59%44%38%4a%62%6b%61%6e%4c%4e%31%4a%54%6a"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5637902></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jkldotio">jkldotio</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5637902">link</a></span></div><br>

We're a well funded 15 month old startup just starting to poke our heads out of stealth mode. We're reimagining what internet access looks like in the modern world. We've proven and prototyped a lot of the necessary components. They work.<p>We are looking for true generalists. Yes, some of our work is in Python and Django, but we also have to work with embedded device C code, internal APIs for client applications, networking and firewall configuration and at times even finding and working around the occasional kernel panic. Silly kernel, everything is going to be OK. You are;<p>* A Polyglot Programmer. Contribute all up and down the stack, from JavaScript and Python to C and shell scripting, from traditional MVC web development down to TCP/IP, DNS and iptables.<p>* Autodidactic. Learning is fun. Prepare to do a lot of it. We have way more components than team members and we intend to keep it that way.<p>* Autonomous. Be comfortable working with minimal oversight. We don’t have any PMs and we don’t plan to hire any for quite some time. Downside: you don’t get a spec. Upside: you don’t get a spec.<p>* Product-focused. Understand and appreciate the human-facing side of the business. You are comfortable thinking through what needs to be prioritized next and how that affects our customers.<p>* Attentive to Detail. You know when to git merge and when to git rebase, and it makes a difference (nobody likes a messy commit history). Your code feels obvious in retrospect. You take pride in your work.<p>* Test-Friendly. The best way to make sure we're creating value for our users is to make sure our changes don't break things.<p>More info on the website, if you're interested you can apply on the site or you can contact me directly at craig at companyname.com for more information.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5639874 href="vote?for=5639874_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%44%38%6d%54%71%35%74%41%59%44%38%4a%62%6b%61%6e%4c%4e%31%4a%54%6a"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5639874></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=fps">fps</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5639874">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>wikiHow (<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Jobs" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Jobs</a>) - Palo Alto<p>We're "Wikipedia for how-to". We have over 40 million monthly users, but only 5 engineers.  That's 8 million users per engineer!<p>==Our vision==
Imagine a world where anyone can easily learn how to do anything. A world where access to comprehensive step-by-step instructions in multiple languages enables billions of people to improve their lives, in both ordinary and extraordinary ways. That’s the world we want to create.<p>==Where==
wikiHow is located in a homey office in downtown Palo Alto, California, three blocks from the Palo Alto Caltrain Station. We also have satellite offices in Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington.<p>==Why we’re different==
* We take wikiHow's educational mission seriously. We put our mission above short-term business goals.
* We pay well. You get the joys of a nonprofit mission with a competitive for-profit salary and benefits package. 
* We have a huge number of users, but a very small team. Your work will make an immediate, noticeable impact on millions of people. 
* We all work from home one day a week.
* We don't think working long startup hours is productive or healthy. We work hard and productively, then go enjoy rich lives outside of work. 
* Our small, cohesive team is gender balanced: 50% female, 50% male.
* We’re often wrong (and that’s OK).  Making mistakes shows that we are innovating. We love to innovate.   
* We like walking. We even have a few treadmill desks.
* We love coming to work every day. Working with intelligent people to accomplish something globally ambitious is intrinsically satisfying. 
* We like to share. We develop open source software and Creative Commons licensed content.  
* With over 40 million readers a month, wikiHow is one of the top 200 sites on the web. Even your mom will use and love our product.
* We are profitable and growing. 
* We are self-funded. We refuse VC money on a regular basis. Investors don’t make our decisions, we do. 
* We are better in person than on TV:  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdfGsYyALI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdfGsYyALI</a>
* We're delightfully quirky (but you probably figured that out already).<p>=== A warning ===
Before you book an appointment with us, you should understand that wikiHow is not hoping to be acquired or looking for a quick financial exit. Our company is already profitable, financially stable (aka your job isn’t going away at someone’s whim), and we all love working here, so we aren’t in a rush to sell it to some big company. In fact, we think we are doing a pretty good job running it, and selling it might mean the end to a product that we all love working on. The team here shares a passion for helping the millions of people we reach everyday. It is an amazing feeling to work on such a popular and impactful product! That amazing feeling makes us smile when we wake up every day and think about going to work. If all of this sounds appealing to you, we encourage you to apply... If this is a bummer, then that’s okay too, we probably aren’t the best fit for you right now...and that’s totally fine!<p>===Engineering at wikiHow===
We have a five-person engineering team and over 40 million users.  That’s more than 8 million users per engineer!  Everything you build will make an immediate impact on millions of people.<p>Some of the problems wikiHow engineers are working on:
* Building user-facing features for our volunteer editing community that are fun enough to gather mass usage, while simultaneously making sure the output of the work produces high-quality educational information. It’s easy to get people to upload funny cat memes on the Web; the real challenge comes when you want them to create and curate the world’s best instructional content. 
* Creating features to bring in new content contributors. To keep growing and achieve our goals, we solve how to enable contributors from mobile devices, as well as continuing to gain new desktop community members.
* Scaling, scaling, scaling.  We get more users before 10 AM than most startups will get in their entire existence. 
* Big data. Lots of usage creates lots of data that we work with to further improve our products.
* Mobile and tablets. The majority of wikiHow users will soon be on portable devices, but they don’t practice typical behavior patterns.  We are rethinking wikis and collaboratively created content for the mobile era. 
* Reader delight features. Better software means happier readers. We’re inventing new ways to make learning pleasant and more efficient.
* Your awesome idea! We value our employees ideas and opinions, and most of our projects originate from people on the team.<p>Our stack:
PHP, Mediawiki, MySQL, Bash, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python, C++, Memcache, Varnish, Nginx, Linux, iOS, Android. This is a partial list, because we also explore and test new technologies.<p>We’re looking for full-stack engineers, and are hiring people with a variety of experience levels and technology interests.<p>Apply at engineering-jobs@wikihow.com

To reduce downtime, companies depend on a global supply chain of warehouses, delivery services, and manufacturers to supply the service parts to maintain the infrastructure of the modern world. Baxter Planning Systems is seeking outstanding Java Developers to optimize and automate every facet of this service parts supply chain.<p>Baxter Planning Systems offers a unique environment combining the flexibility of a startup with the stability of an established company. Our developers are involved in the entire product lifecycle, from problem description to design and execution. 20 years of established business with numerous satisfied customers provides ongoing revenue that isolates us from the anxiety of funding cycles or the constant search for the next big deal.<p>Working closely with on-staff domain experts, our developers have the opportunity to learn about the complexities of global supply chain management, and offer their own solutions to the challenges it presents. Challenges like planning optimal stocking levels for tens of thousands of parts distributed across thousands of locations worldwide, combined with complex interdependencies due to substitutability, regulatory issues, and the need to minimize both downtime and cost.<p>The ideal candidate for Baxter is a smart developer who gets things done by applying technology, especially open source, to meet our goals while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. The development and QA teams work closely with key stakeholders to formulate and manage development timelines that are both realistic and produce high-quality application features. You won't have to start from scratch either: we have a great infrastructure of automated unit/integration/regression/UI tests, automated builds, virtualized test environments, and a solid technology stack. But we recognize there's always room for improvement and welcome the experience and expertise you'd bring in improving our development practices, tools, and execution.<p>Regretfully at this time we are unable to accommodate 3rd party placement agencies, H-1B sponsorships,  long-term telecommuting, or relocation.

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We’re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we’re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.<p>We recently secured a new round of funding, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers.

In the last 3.5 years, the company has grown from 2 guys in a living room to a company that helps hundreds of thousands of customers buy and sell over $100,000 in gift cards each day.  We have been featured on CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, NPR, and The New York Times.<p>We pride ourselves on being an engineering-focused group (with experience @ Apple, Google, Amazon.com, Microsoft, MIT, CMU, UIUC, Harvard, and Brown) that moves quickly and builds great customer experiences. Some of the interesting technical and business challenges we're working on include real-time inventory management, dynamic pricing problems, high-performance transaction processing, security, data mining, API design, and ping-pong matchmaking algorithms :)<p>The ideal candidate would be excited by the prospect of working on a small group of highly technical engineers and enjoy having a ton of responsibility while learning something new almost daily.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>New York, NY - Fulltime<p>Hiring: FE Engineer _#38; Head of Marketing/Biz-dev<p>iknow.io is a data-driven knowledge sharing community for curious people.<p>We take raw data about Movies, Music, Sports, Economics, Politics and more and make it possible for regular people to analyze and extract useful information from it. We also enable them to browse, share and discuss the fascinating insights they discover with one another.<p>While there are mountains of raw data out there, only scientists and programmers can currently make any real use of it. Our mission is to make that data accessible and useful to everyone.<p>Our team has extensive experience working with large, complex data problems and in building and nurturing online communities.<p>We are currently a team of 4 people, and are looking to add 2 more talented individuals to the mix immediately.<p>1) FE Engineer:  You have a great design sense and some serious engineering skills.  You think the famous quote, "there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things" is spot on.  Whenever you're browsing the web, you're constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved.  You're a pragmatist who's ok with ignoring IE6 users.  You've built complex, popular web-based applications before.  You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead.<p>Our FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css.  Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required.  Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.<p>2) Head of Marketing _#38; Business Development: You're a natural born deal maker.  When you throw a party, too many people show up.  You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign.  Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you.  You believe product design and marketing are one and the same.  You're ready to join an extremely talented product _#38; engineering team and show them that everything they thought they knew about how to really promote and grow a new site from the ground-up is wrong.<p>If you fit the bill for either of these positions, and you think what we're working on sounds intriguing, then we'd love to hear from you at jobs@iknow.io.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Sydney (Darlinghurst), Australia<p>SiteTour is looking for a full-time developer to join our team.<p>We're a small startup - currently it's 2 full-timers (1 business, 1 tech [me]) plus some freelancers, advisors and partners. We're building a platform for the out-of-home advertising industry (billboards, bus shelters, buses, shopping centre panels, etc)<p>Our current tech stack is Java (GWT/Spring/Hibernate), Geoserver, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), MySQL; but it's not set in stone.<p>It's a full stack analysis+development role, taking changes from requirement through to testing, from front-end through to the database, and also assist in providing operational support for the live site.<p>We have lots of opportunities that we're working through, and things are pretty fast-paced, so we need someone who is happy to receive requirements that are very loosely defined, flesh them out, produce a design (either in your head, or on paper depending on the size of the work) and then see it through development and testing.<p>We're based in Darlinghurst (Sydney, Australia) and we're looking for someone who can be physically present in the office, but there's plenty of flexibility (we're happy to have a mix of work in the office/work from home). Sorry, we're not set up to sponsor overseas applicants at this time.<p>The things we care about (in rough order)<p>- Good cultural fit. It's a small team so we'll be seeing a lot of each other, and we want that to be something we're all happy about<p>- A team player who can work with minimal supervision. We're busy and everyone's got a lot on their plate, so we want to be able to help each other out, but we also need everyone to be able to pick up their own work and run with it.<p>- Happy to work full stack _#38; full life-cycle. One day might be spent brainstorming how we want some end-user features to work, and the next day spent neck deep in code. If you like that sort of variety, that's a good thing.<p>- Happy to work with our technology stack, and able to productive quickly. I don't care too much whether you have GWT or AWS experience, as long as you're happy to work with it, and happy to put the effort in to get up to speed fast. Obviously if having experience makes those things easier.<p>In return we can offer<p>- Flexible work arrangements. Both of us (the 2 full-timers)  have young kids, so if you're in a similar situation we're happy to talk about how we can accommodate.<p>- A chance to do Java development in Sydney without working for a bank/telco/consultancy. Those who work in Sydney will know that there's only a handful of interesting companies, and the rest is big corporate dev work (I know, I've done lots of it). If you've got a Java skillset but want to break out of that world, then here's an opportunity.<p>- A fun office environment. We share office space with a couple of like-minded companies, and I think it's a fun place - hopefully you will too.<p>Feel free to ask questions here, or email me<p><i>User:</i> tim<p><i>Domain:</i> sitetour.com.au</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5638978 href="vote?for=5638978_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%68%69%73%45%5a%76%61%44%46%50%7a%51%45%6f%56%39%61%42%63%37%6c"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5638978></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=lobasaurusrex">lobasaurusrex</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5638978">link</a></span></div><br>

One awesome startup house in Austin, TX. A boxer-pug puppy named Heidi Klum. And an awesome team of six friends and colleagues.<p>We run a marketplace where students can purchase lessons online or over the phone with a nationwide network of tennis instructors. SEO is our game and over 75% of our customers come from organic traffic. Why tennis? Our founders met on the University of Connecticut tennis team and have been instructors themselves. We ran the business manually and with thousands of static pages for a whole year while teaching ourselves to code and eventually adding another rails developer to the team.<p>Summer nears and our application has come a long way. It works. But we want it to do more than work. We want it to provide an amazing experience, for our students, for our instructors, and for ourselves as we continue to build, test, and iterate. We want an Ember App.<p>Here’s some reasons why:
-We sell lessons for individuals or groups of 2-6 in pre-set ‘lesson packages’, each with their own per-lesson-price. Which should be displayed as the student chooses their options. With one line of code.
-Our existing tennis court location manager and schedule availability features are just calling to be Emberified
-Happiness is a readable code base
-Page loads are for suckas
-And more<p>Think you can help get us there? Let us know. We’re a laid back group that enjoys working hard and generating value. Ideally we’d like to find another team member with some experience and looking to explore a new adventure. If you’re interested, send an e-mail introducing yourself and providing some links to code samples/contributions to michael@mytennislessons.com.<p>P.S. And yes, we know there’s other types of fitness professionals out there who could use a similar service.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Causes.com - San Francisco - Relocation Available - FT<p>Causes.com is looking for great software engineers to join our growing eng team (currently 20). Design, build and deliver innovative tools that inspire people to create social change from their corner of the world. You’ll give people the ability to support their beliefs, clean up political corruption and provide real-time relief to those in need. Engineers at Causes tend to be jack-of-all-trades, though we love people who have mastered a specific part of the stack, from front-end to back-end and all the data in between. We believe that the only way to create change is for people to work together; it's the principle that guides how we run our company. From deep-dive product debates to catered lunch chats, every great idea gets its day at Causes. We encourage each other's interests just as much as we foster professional growth, and here those two tend to be one and the same.<p>We are currently hiring for software engineers and one iOS engineer. Read more about the positions at (<a href="http://causes.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">http://causes.com/jobs</a>)<p>Below are some common questions we get from engineers who are interested, and one of our awesome engineers has decided to answer them:<p>Q: What is your team environment like? 
A: The team environment is extremely open and loose. Our engineering team has a flat structure - one of our explicit goals is to create a space where we are all on equal footing to create opportunities to teach ourselves and learn from each other. We encourage everyone to be constantly questioning and evaluating our development processes so that we can keep getting better over time. Every engineer has a tremendous amount of power in terms of identifying what the most impactful things to be working on are, and to take on those challenges with the support of the team.<p>Q: Are you a pretty casual startup or more corporate styled? 
A: We have a couple key meetings each week. Each morning we have a standup that we expect the whole team to be present for; having the team start the day together is important to us. We finish each week with a retrospective where we gather around a whiteboard, have some drinks, and consider the process for the week. Taking time each week to reflect on what went well and how we can replicate success, as well as what didn't and how we can avoid similar mistakes in the future makes this feel like one of the healthiest teams I have ever been a part of.<p>Q: Do you guys pair program? 
A: We definitely encourage pairing - I probably spend about a quarter of my time coding with a partner, and I'm trying to find ways to do even more. We used to have pairing stations set up explicitly for this (two keyboards, two mice, four monitors), but as our team has gotten more comfortable with other solutions like screen sharing via tmux the pairing stations have gently fallen into disuse. I would love to hear what setups you have found to be successful in encouraging good pairing sessions. We're always looking to find more ways to effectively collaborate!<p>Q: What is the developer life like?
A: In my opinion, the developer life at Causes is pretty spectacular. I get to work with some of the most awesome people I know, both technically and in a wide variety of other talents and interests. Jimmy, who leads our engineering team, used to be a performing stage magician. Rocky works with our Impact team and has represented the US in Ultimate Frisbee tournaments. There is a level of passion in my coworkers that I've never seen anywhere else, and I get to spend my time working, eating, talking, and playing with these people. As a developer, I get to work with fantastic technology. We are constantly upgrading our stack, and I often get to learn about things that are new to me. Most of our devs spend the day ssh'd into a workstation editing code in Vim, although we have one dev who tunnels the filesystem so that he can work in RubyMine, and at different times we have had folks working in TextMate, Sublime, Emacs, and Eclipse. All of our code goes through a code review tool called Gerrit that we use both to prevent software defects and as a way to teach each other about our craft. Gerrit is integrated with our Jenkins CI so that every patch has the complete test suite run against it before being merged.<p>We work in small development teams that generally include four developers, a product manager, and a designer. These teams give engineering access to the product design process that I haven't seen at the other companies I have been at. There's a neat sense of satisfaction when you are pairing with a designer to tweak a page into perfection. Working directly with the product team means that we get a lot of insight into what is coming down the pipe, and can often contribute to the direction of the product.<p>------------<p>Have you seen enough and you're now interested in joining the team? Please send over some code samples and a linked/resume to jobs@causes.com with "HN" in the subject line.<p>Thanks!

In such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Smarkets, London, VP of Engineering and Software Engineer, Python, Erlang _#38; Mobile<p>Smarkets is disrupting the global betting industry by offering a modern betting exchange with significantly lower transaction fees than the competition. We're a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over £300 million of bets since launching in 2010. Smarkets has been featured in publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.<p>We're building a reliable, low-latency exchange system to facilitate automated traded strategies, as well as a fast, modern web interface. Our team constantly works on significant, challenging software engineering problems; if you're fed up of writing yet another boring CMS, we might be able to help.<p>The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques and REST. We make extensive use of version control, configuration management and automated testing, which allows us to reliably deploy code to production several times a day.<p>Our team builds on a modern, open-source software stack which includes Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, Graphite, Chef and Git.<p>For more info: <a href="https://smarkets.com/about/jobs/" rel="nofollow">https://smarkets.com/about/jobs/</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5639116 href="vote?for=5639116_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%68%69%73%45%5a%76%61%44%46%50%7a%51%45%6f%56%39%61%42%63%37%6c"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5639116></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jeffallen6767">jeffallen6767</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5639116">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm a RoR developer working at a company in the Bay Area called Coupa Software. We're a provider of e-procurement software, which is enterprisey stuff that helps large companies manage their internal spending. Tech reporters often describe us as "Mint.com for businesses" but that's only a small part of what we do.<p>We generally target lots of very enterprisey customers, but we're still pretty small and not-corporate. At the moment the dev team (including PMs, UX, etc) is about 20 people. I like to think we're at a pretty good balance between startup and big company.<p>We're currently hiring "Ruby on Rails Developer, Integrations Engineer, Front End Developer, UX Designer, Visual Designer", but imho we're mostly in need of full stack devs. This company is growing very very very quickly, and flexible developers who can wear many hats are the best for that<p>We're in downtown San Mateo, 1 block from Caltrain. REMOTES, H1Bs, TNs (I am one! from Canada eh?) are all ok. Competitive pay, 401k, health insurance. WFH privileges, flex time, all that good stuff. An unlimited PTO system.  And as a personal anecdote: I've experienced almost no overtime here, and virtually no pressure to overwork myself. Coupa respects a healthy work-life balance.  There's a lot of room for self-management here; work the way you work best, show results, and you'll be given the freedom to do it however you like.<p>If anyone is interested, mail me at tim.herd @ coupa.com, paste your resume, github link, maybe a cover letter if you're feeling generous :D. If you're experienced with Rails (or someone who can get up to speed with minimal training), we'd love to have you.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5640483 href="vote?for=5640483_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%68%69%73%45%5a%76%61%44%46%50%7a%51%45%6f%56%39%61%42%63%37%6c"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5640483></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=thinker">thinker</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5640483">link</a></span></div><br>

Following that, creative thinking and problem solving will be key as we come up with more efficient and effective ways to get the firm's work done.<p>A love of baseball (and sports in general) is useful since we work in that world -- but it's not strictly required. We take great pride in being the best at what we do, and most of us have played team sports at a high level. It's a great place to work with low turnover, and we're excited to find someone new to join our team.<p>This is a full-time position in our Newport Beach office.<p>Obviously we're not your typical HN poster, but if it sounds like a good fit let us know at jobs at borascorp.com.<p>More information about us and our work: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Boras" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Boras</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5637702 href="vote?for=5637702_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%68%69%73%45%5a%76%61%44%46%50%7a%51%45%6f%56%39%61%42%63%37%6c"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5637702></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=vimeojobs">vimeojobs</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5637702">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Two Sigma (SoHo, NYC) - Full Time, Intern, H1B<p>At our core, we're a technology company applying our talents to the domain of finance. We've created a system that combines artificial intelligence and keen human insight—a system that's constantly improving and advancing.
We're looking for a diverse set of technologists to join our team. Our challenges require mastery of areas such as kernel level development, machine learning, and distributed systems. Our team includes a Unix Lifetime Achievement winner, Putnam medalists, ACM Programming competition finalists, and International Mathematics Olympiad medalists. We are proud of our individual pedigrees, but even prouder of our teamwork.<p>We tend to hire people with at least a bachelor’s degree in a technical or quantitative field and experience with C or languages that target the JVM, but we are open-minded in our search for critical thinkers who are passionate about technology. We analyze the data-rich domain of finance, but financial experience is not a requirement. We hope to hear from you! stacey.winning@twosigma.com

We figured there must be some sales guys on here who love technology but their skills and passion are in sales, and are looking for a startup to join. If that sounds like you, don't bother scrolling down; there won't be many more of these.<p>Basically, we have the technology (cue Six Million Dollar Man theme) and we need you to help us turn it into money and happy customers.<p><i>The Product</i><p>Unifyo is a genius product that can accelerate millions of people’s workflow (e.g. in sales or customer service) by having instant access to unified customer profiles.<p><i>The Plan</i><p>You’ll proactively reach out to new and existing users (= leads) of Unifyo. Instead of cold calling potential clients, you focus on making sure that current users use Unifyo successful inside their companies and with their colleagues, so they feel comfortable paying for it. We’ll expect you to organise the sales approach, process and tools yourself and come back with results. The whole team will support you in your exciting quest providing the metrics and customer data you'll need to increase Unifyo's revenues from thousands to millions.<p><i>What we (think) we need from you</i><p>• You have at least 2 years of sales experience with demonstrable sales targets achieved, along with a track record of selling software solutions (SaaS) over the phone and face to face.<p>• You have received formal sales training.<p>• You have an innate hunger for personal and company success combined with a great personality.<p>• You have a solid understanding of web, enterprise, and SaaS technologies.<p>• You have a strong interest in tech (that's why you're on Hacker News) but you also have the ability to clearly explain complicated ideas to a non-technical audience. Try explaining Facebook to your grandmother before applying.<p><i>What's next</i><p>For more information, and to apply, get in touch with me (Robin) or Ben (our names at unifyo.com), or check out the full job at <a href="https://unifyo.com/jobs-sales" rel="nofollow">https://unifyo.com/jobs-sales</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5639747 href="vote?for=5639747_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%68%69%73%45%5a%76%61%44%46%50%7a%51%45%6f%56%39%61%42%63%37%6c"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5639747></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Jamiecon">Jamiecon</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5639747">link</a></span></div><br>

We use a wide array of data science techniques -- machine learning, information retrieval, entity reconciliation, you name it -- to help companies do more with their customers.<p>We want to bring this type of data intelligence into the enterprise space. Companies like Google and Facebook are developing very fancy algorithms and pushing the state of the art to bring amazing insights into... which cat video you should click on next? Incredible smarts are being applied for seemingly trivial things in the consumer space, while in the enterprise space, decision-making is still mostly gut-driven, at most supplemented by a few Excel charts. This shouldn't be. Enterprise companies, who are solving important problems and paying salaries, whose survival depends on allocating their limited resources optimally, need to be brought forth to the cutting edge. They need to leverage their data better. They need to make their decisions smarter.<p>This is what we do. We identify problems that are common across companies and are ripe for more intelligence, and we build end-to-end solutions that alleviate those pain points and create value. Our growing list of paying customers include Box, Yammer, Zendesk, Jive, Tableau and Rackspace, and we're just getting started.<p>And we're excited to have recently raised $10 million in Series A funding, led by Redpoint Ventures, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz, Social+Capital Partnership, Sutter Hill Ventures, Nexus Venture Partners, and many esteemed angel investors:<p><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-24/infer-promises-more-sales-through-better-math" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-24/infer-promis...</a><p>We're building an amazing team with folks from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Google Research, Microsoft Research, IBM Research, Yahoo Research and Palantir, so if you're an engineer eager to work on a product that will provide real value and alleviate some real pain points for its users, and if you're hungry to help us grow and shape our young startup, please check out <a href="https://www.infer.com/careers.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.infer.com/careers.html</a> and drop us a note!<p>(PS: Oh yeah, the next cat video for you is this one: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-u8sLbBcnk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-u8sLbBcnk</a>)<p>Thanks for reading.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5638280 href="vote?for=5638280_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%68%69%73%45%5a%76%61%44%46%50%7a%51%45%6f%56%39%61%42%63%37%6c"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5638280></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nathanh">nathanh</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5638280">link</a></span></div><br>

A brief description is below, but I've worked in the Service Performance group for a number of years and can try to answer any questions you may have about what we do.  Reach out to me via my personal email address in my HN profile.<p>Overview:
Media Performance is the Akamai group with end-to-end responsibility for ensuring that our Media services are performing well. A well-performing service, in addition to being fast and available, also needs to be robust and well-operated. Media Performance team members need to have very strong communication skills to enable them to work across all areas of the company (especially engineering, operations, networking, and technical services).<p>Responsibilities:
* Collect and analyze data from a network serving 10s of millions of hits per second to discern trends and anomalies.
* Work in a distributed network / content delivery environment on Linux and Windows, applying advanced skills in network diagnostics and debugging tools, and the related network protocols and implementations, routing protocols, and application level protocols to measure, analyze, characterize and improve performance, robustness, availability and scalability of large distributed content delivery systems.
* Identify and implement new approaches to improving performance and reliability, including scoping, designing, and implementing software features for new and existing software systems, from kernel changes to distributed server applications.
* Prototype substantial system modifications to serve as proofs of concept for large system development initiatives.
* Work in and with teams across all technical areas in the Company including engineering, customer care and professional services to enable innovative new solutions in both live and test network for complex issues that span multiple technologies and services often to meet specific customer needs.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5638225 href="vote?for=5638225_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%68%69%73%45%5a%76%61%44%46%50%7a%51%45%6f%56%39%61%42%63%37%6c"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5638225></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Hovertruck">Hovertruck</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5638225">link</a></span></div><br>

If you're talented and in Northern Illinois(or Southern WI for that matter), we want to hear from you.<p>We offer competive salary, health insurance with company HSA contribution, dental, good PTO schedules, and all other manner of niceties.
Company info: We're a well established company with many big clients. The company has been around for 20+ years in various iterations with the latest product cycle about 10-15 years old. We've recently been acquired by a couple of Silicon Valley backed gentlemen who see our potential and want to compete toe to toe with IBM in the Managed File Transfer domain. We're revamping products, spinning up marketing, staffing up and taking over the world. It is a startup atmosphere in an established company.

The number of businesses using OpenStack in general and Swift in particular grows and grows, and it includes big names that make products that are used by both your little brother and your grandmother. You’ll work on a product that makes core OpenStack technology accessible to businesses of all kinds.<p>You’ll get open-source experience in a big way. At SwiftStack, we’re committed to strong participation in the OpenStack ecosystem in general and to contribution to Swift in particular. You’ll be a contributor to one of the most important Open Source projects currently active.<p>You’ll confront interesting problems every day. Writing a system like Swift and building a software ecosystem to surround it is the road less traveled. We aren’t writing yet another glorified CMS or social app or phone game. Whether it’s figuring out better algorithms for data placement, confronting a firehose of monitoring data, or determining how to integrate most flexibly with customers’ systems, there are always new and unusual problems to solve.<p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done. Tell us in a few lines of text why you’re interested in SwiftStack, and why we’ll be interested in you.

Our team is diverse, dedicated and brainy. If you enjoy working on challenging problems then Moonshadow may be the place for you.<p>We develop cutting-edge technology or "Big Data" visualization. Our technology retrieves and tallies geospatial data at extremely high speeds, typically 100 times faster than traditional databases.

We routinely bring up databases for customers with tens of millions of records. Our customers are typically large government organizations or companies that need to quickly understand or access large databases.<p>Please email your resume and salary requirements to jobs@moonshadowmobile.com. Be sure to include examples of mobile apps, code, graphics and websites you've worked on. This is an in-house position in downtown Eugene. No telecommuting.<p>Requirements:

Sharewave is for entrepreneurs and private companies who care deeply about their investors. It’s a beautifully simple way to organize, visualize and share information with investors and shareholders.

A team of 9 with financial, technology, and startup backgrounds (we’ve worked at places like E*TRADE, Deloitte, Accenture, Morgan Stanley). More about us here: <a href="http://blog.sharewave.com/post/44974195141/the-sharewave-team" rel="nofollow">http://blog.sharewave.com/post/44974195141/the-sharewave-tea...</a><p>[Who we're looking for:]
A front-end and/or back-end engineer to work directly with our CTO (r0ml). Our technical challenges are more about flexibility and customization and less about scalability. Some things we care about:
    - working knowledge of one of the following: Java, JavaScript, Postgresql, Python
    - proficiency with web and mobile technologies (OAuth, REST,  Gesture APIs, ec2)<p>[Specifics:]
We’re working in a new co-working space in midtown Manhattan, which hosts a number of startups and small businesses (along with unlimited coffee, tea and beer).

The Genome Institute is a world-leader in the generation and analysis of genomic sequence data and uses this data to extend biological knowledge of the human genome and provide clinically relevant sequence analysis aimed at understanding human diseases (such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease). In addition, the Institute fosters public understanding of genomic science through various educational and outreach efforts.<p>Job Qualifications<p>The ideal candidate has a talent and love for writing software, is interested in developing that skill, and applying it in a production environment. The candidate will be expected to learn new things on a regular basis, think critically, and collaborate with other developers across groups. The environment is fast-paced and a person who likes to get things done will find a lot of opportunity.<p>Design, testing, debugging, and problem analysis are a regular part of the work. Skills in abstract software design, object-oriented architecture, relational data modeling, and web interface design will be used frequently, which will require thorough knowledge of each concept. The applicant will use these skills to develop software that will: interface with people and/or laboratory equipment, process and analyze large data sets on a compute cluster, and provide intuitive web based interfaces to the specifications of the laboratory managers and technicians.<p>Proficiency in dynamically typed languages (Perl, Ruby, Python, Lisp, etc.) is a plus, but not required. Understanding of relational databases and SQL will be helpful. Experience with web technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and approaches such as REST and AJAX is an asset. Regular work will be done in GNU/Linux and other UNIX-like development environments. Familiarity with open source technologies, version control software such as git, and programming in a network environment are also assets.<p>Certification or degree in computer programming from a technical school or college plus two years of relevant work experience required. Additional relevant programming experience may be substituted on a year-for-year basis for required education.<p>You can also send questions and resumes directly to me.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5640958 href="vote?for=5640958_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%52%4f%49%70%61%49%41%48%67%6e%48%50%6f%55%75%42%6d%46%4e%73%57%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5640958></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=cmbaus">cmbaus</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5640958">link</a></span></div><br>

Right now we are redefining how SaaS products get delivered by building a first-of-its-kind application.<p>Bucking the common trend to build multiple native apps, which we feel is the antithesis of SaaS development, we are building a responsive single page web application. We don’t know of any other large scale apps (certainly none in this sector) that are targeting so many devices with a single codebase. But we are not about sticking with the pack.<p>That’s where you come in. We’re looking for the Indiana Jones of web development, a front-end dev who can navigate through the multi-platform/device/browser jungle that is the modern web.<p>You’ll be joining a team of passionate web geeks in our London office working for a profitable, fast growing startup. We’re not dependant on rounds of VC funding to stay afloat and your work will quickly find it’s way into the hands of thousands of existing users.<p>What you will bring to the team is technical expertise building interactive UIs and a wealth of experience making web applications work across different devices and browsers. Bonus points if you’ve got experience working in a client side application architecture as well.<p>You are obsessed about details. You do a sneaky victory dance whenever you knock 7ms off render time. You do more than just make things work. You come up with ingenious and elegant solutions, and you understand the quirks that make browsers behave differently. Although design isn’t necessarily your thing, you still work tirelessly to achieve pixel perfection.<p>You’re someone who stays up-to-date with what’s happening at the leading edge of web development. You easily formulate your own ideas and are able to make clear arguments for your opinions.<p>Core Skills<p>* JavaScript<p>* HTML/CSS<p>* RWD<p>* Code profiling, perf and optimisation<p>* Tooling (e.g. Chrome DevTools, the Command Line)<p>* Best practises (be prepared to write them)<p>Bonus points!<p>* Client side application frameworks, i.e. Backbone.js (hint: we use Backbone.js)<p>* Scrum/Agile<p>* Version control<p>* SASS<p>* REST (API, not sleeping at your desk)<p>Type: Permanent<p>Hours: Mon-Fri, 9:00-17:30<p>Salary: DOE<p>Benefits: Private medical insurance, 21 days paid holiday<p>You need to be ambitious and able to turn a list of problems into a list of solutions.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Chicago, IL<p>Help MarkITx[1] build the software systems that will track, value and trade the world’s IT infrastructure. Working side-by-side with our CTO Ben Blair (that's me) and our head of product Shawn Kelly, you’ll design and build a web of distributed systems sitting atop our AWS infrastructure. You'll have full ownership of your projects and the systems you work on. You'll never be micromanaged.<p>We're looking for engineers who have built, deployed and managed large distributed systems. We're pragmatists, not purists.  We try to use the right technology for the job, with familiarity being a tie breaker. Some things we use today: Node.js, ElasticSearch, Redis and CouchDB and a slew of AWS services.<p>The types of project you might work on:<p>- An automated market making system for wholesalers<p>- An inventory import that can identify products in anything from poorly formatted spreadsheets to scanned invoice PDFs to photos of asset tags<p>- A public-facing API for asset valuation and trading<p>We Offer:<p>- Great work environment + generous equipment budget<p>- Base salary in the $110 - $130k range + significant equity<p>- Raise to $160 - $180k when we close our Series A<p>- Benefits including health, dental<p>About MarkITx<p>MarkITx is a B2B exchange for buying and selling IT hardware (anything that goes into a datacenter). We are disrupting the $350B secondary IT market by bringing simplicity and transparency to a process that is currently painful, ugly and untrustworthy. We are a well funded startup, working out of 1871. We are a very talented, deeply experienced and tight-knit team. We have some of the best backers and advisors in Chicago. We’ve proven the model, with over $60MM in orders and over $150k per month in transactions. We’re just getting started, and we need your help to scale.<p>Our culture is driven by a simple constraint: every colleague we add should make the rest of the team happier and better at their own jobs. That means talent density grows as we grow. It means we have zero tolerance for ego-driven BS. It means we’re in awe of what our colleagues are capable of. It means we have complete autonomy to identify and solve the problems in our domain. It means we care more about the win than we do about who did what to get us there.<p>Email me at ben@markitx.com if you're interested and tell me about what you've built.<p>[1] <a href="https://www.markitx.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.markitx.com</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5639320 href="vote?for=5639320_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%52%4f%49%70%61%49%41%48%67%6e%48%50%6f%55%75%42%6d%46%4e%73%57%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5639320></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=michool">michool</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5639320">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Berlin, Full-time Unity Mobile Game Developer, Good chunk of equity (Late Co-Founder) 7-10% Equity, Salary to cover living expenses, we help with relocation<p>Join our team of 4 game enthusiast (2 artists, 1 dev, 1 biz)
- We are on a mission to redefine strategy gaming for smartphones (no more please wait 32 hours to build a goddamn house) 
- Founded Autumn 2012
- Angel Funded<p>Requirements:
Burning passion to build (strategy) games for gamers (not 35 year old moms)
Experience in developing kickass games with unity<p>Please send me an email: felix@hardscoregames.com<p>Felix
Founder<p>5 Reasons to move to Berlin (thanks Node.js - great summary)
1. Lowest livings costs with highest standard of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a car—Berlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun + we have Car2Go and Drive-Now (these are world's best smartphone-supported car sharing systems with brand new cars at every corner, cheaper than owning a car or riding a cab). In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).
2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird, Mozilla and many more).
3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and international—no need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.
4. Easy work permissions—Europeans do not need any and can work from day one.
5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.
Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, we’d love to talk with you. If you don't live in Berlin yet, we could help to fix that.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5638707 href="vote?for=5638707_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%52%4f%49%70%61%49%41%48%67%6e%48%50%6f%55%75%42%6d%46%4e%73%57%33"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_5638707></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tipbit">tipbit</a> 158 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5638707">link</a></span></div><br>

Voxer iOS and Android apps allow tens of millions of users across the world to communicate instantly. We're making voice and multimedia communication faster, more efficient, and more social. Our goal is ambitious - we're building the next generation communication voice service at the intersection between PTT, phone calls, SMS, conference calls, and multimedia messaging.<p>It's no small feat to achieve, to keep one of the world's fastest growing voice applications humming along and growing at a phenomenal pace. But we are 50 dedicated individuals who are putting some of the most exciting technology in the world to work right now - we are the world's largest Node.js site, and we also run one of the largest Riak clusters in the world.<p>We are dedicated and solely focused on building the next generation of communication. The problems we're facing are at a scale only seen at companies like Twitter and Facebook and we're looking for exceptional people who can help us tackle them.<p>We closed our first outside round of funding last spring, and our brand new offices are right off Market Street in San Francisco. There's tons of restaurants and shopping nearby at Westfield and Union Square to spend your hard earned cash on, and if you're a musician there's a few outside on the street that we wouldn't mind you teaching a few new songs to. There are plenty of MUNI lines right outside, BART is a block away, plus the Ferry to Oakland and Marin is a pleasant fifteen minute stroll or five minute bus ride away.<p>We are hiring across the board and looking for Front End Engineers, iOS Engineers, Android Engineers, Server Engineers, and more!<p>Check out our site for a complete list of open jobs.

I was working for a start-up called LucidMedia Networks (hence the "lmn" in the e-mail address below), which got acquired by Videology.  The Baltimore office is a .NET shop, but the Reston office is Java on *nix (Mac for dev, Linux in production, and no plans to use Microsoft anything for development).  Our stack is Java on Spring with MySQL and some NoSQL stores on AWS.  We have some big projects in the works involving big data and volume as we scale globally and across mediums (video, mobile, etc.).  Currently, our Reston platform alone handles 4 billion requests a day.<p>Contact me directly at sahil_lmn@yahoo.com.<p>I actually got hired through a HN "Who is Hiring" thread, and I hired an intern through these threads.

We’re technology agnostic and believe the best developers can teach themselves what they need to learn.
