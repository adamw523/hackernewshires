<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>NYC (Union Square) - Chicago - SFBay (Mountain View)<p>Matasano.<p>Job title: Scary Story Told To Young Software Developers By Their Parents To Get Them To Go To Bed On Time.<p>We break software. To do it, in the past year, we've filled up Riak clusters with raw HTTP requests, built a large-scale source code cross referencer for 30 languages, wrote and rewrote a debugger core in Ruby, wrote another in Go, built software fuzzer farms with Redis, tested 3 different proprietary trading protocols, broke sandboxing schemes, built tools to attack chipsets, broke numerous cryptosystems, and gave several talks at Black Hat.<p>Our customers are excellent; they include Github, 37signals, and numerous YC companies.<p>Our team is even better. What are we looking for? Here's my first interview question: "what is your research project going to be for us?" Does this stuff interest you? We should talk. WE LOVE TALKING TO DEVELOPERS. You don't have to be a "rock star ninja shaolin grandmaster security pro", wear the right jeans, or listen to Animal Collective (please don't listen to Animal Collective). We just want you to be able to learn fast and not get scared when you're faced with wacky systems in languages you've never used and there's a clock ticking.<p>Downsides: Not building things people want. In fact, building things people fear and loathe. Also, not being able to wear silver, eat garlic, or enter houses without express invitation.<p>Perks: Infinite free tech books, medical, dental, vision, 401k.<p><i>If I were looking for a day job, I wouldn't be looking for a day job any more: they're friendly, happy people who get social license to join the Dark Side, do smart stuff all 
day, and then go home while it is still light out.</i> - HN:patio11<p>More than you ever wanted to know about our recruiting process:<p><a href="http://www.matasano.com/careers" rel="nofollow">http://www.matasano.com/careers</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4324618 href="vote?for=4324618_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%33%32%33%35%39%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4324618></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=solutionyogi">solutionyogi</a> 306 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4324618">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Jose, Santa Cruz :: Build FPGA design tools at Altera<p>Altera is one of the leading designers of FPGA devices in the world. I'm an engineer in the software team, developing mostly embedded design and instrumentation tools for FPGAs. We are looking for software developers experienced or with a strong desire to learn about Computer Architecture, FPGA design, Digital Logic, Embedded Systems, and more, while at the same time developing engineering design  tools in high level languages.<p>To give you an idea of what we do, these are some of the projects that involved me at Altera :<p><pre><code>  * Designed and implemented a high performance on-chip network that's used
    in thousands of routers, base stations, and switches around the world.
  * Created a hardware/software instrumentation framework in a mix of Java, C++, C, 
    and Verilog. This is the foundation for all the debuggers at Altera.
  * Modified the GCC toolchain to add support for Altera's processors, like our
    NiosII soft processor.
  * Implemented a GDB Server from scratch in Java.
  * Defined and implemented the pieces of an ARM CoreSight debug subsystem.
  * Implemented infrastructure used in a C-to-Gates compiler.
  * Spent hours hacking away with the tools and many of the available
    development boards.
</code></pre>
If the above sound interesting to you, then Altera might be the place that you've been looking for. Send me an email to sbrugada at altera.com telling me why you think this would be a good match.

Custora also integrates with email marketing providers and customer support systems to fuel a seamless, iterative flow of insights to actions.<p>From Fab.com to Etsy, some of the fastest growing and respected names in retail are using Custora on a daily basis.<p>Who We’re Looking For<p>We’re looking for a developer to join our core team. Our web stack is Ruby on Rails, and our analytics are done in R. Experience with these technologies is a plus, but we’re open to sharp developers with experience building products for the web in general.<p>Where We Are<p>Location-wise, we’re in Brooklyn, NY. We love it. Progress-wise, we’re a YC company from Winter 2011. We’ve recently been featured in the New York Times, GigaOm and BetaKit, and in the last 2 months we’ve had more signups than in the previous 10.<p>Day to Day
Here’s a taste of what happened last month:<p>Aaron implemented a Dirichlet Latent Class Multinomial to power customer archetype analysis based on customer purchasing behavior.<p>Martin made dramatic improvements the email marketing part of the product. He made it easier for our clients to launch multiple email tests in parallel, and added four new email providers to our growing list of integrated partners.<p>Jon and David worked together to completely redesign the interface of the application. We moved from an interface that focused on browsing through dashboards to one that delivers answers to specific questions.<p>Outside the office, Corey and Dave manned a booth at a big e-retailer conference and developed a Blackjack-style Custora game to play with prospective clients.<p>What We Offer<p>Our compensation is competitive with anyone on the market. Since you’ll be a core member of the team, meaningful equity is part of the package. We offer comprehensive health coverage, including a dental and vision package. Lunches are paid for and we usually eat as a team. We do happy hours at least twice a month and play bocce ball competitively (sort of). Our vacation policy is based on trust — take what’s needed and keep the rest of the team up to speed.<p>Let’s Chat<p>If you’re interested, apply online at

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA. Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>It's widely held that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. We believe that faster sharing of research will lead to an acceleration in research innovation: faster innovation in medicine, biology, engineering, economics, and other fields. Faster sharing in biology and medicine, for example, could lead to cancer being solved 12 months before it otherwise would have been, which would lead to millions of lives being saved.<p>Academia.edu has over 1.5 million registered users, and over 3.5 million monthly unique visitors. Both of these metrics tripled in 2011. Over 4,500 papers are added to the platform each day, and over 3,500 academics join each day.<p>We need talented engineers to help us accelerate the world's research. We believe that science is currently dysfunctional, and that there is a chance to make a big impact.<p>We just raised $4.5 million from Spark Capital and True Ventures <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3297812</a>. Some of our angel investors include Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu) and Rupert Pennant-Rea (Chairman of The Economist).<p>We have a strong engineering culture. We're a 10 person team based in downtown San Francisco. The site is Rails, and other technologies we use include PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, Mongodb, Beanstalkd.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. There is more information about the company on our hiring page, at <a href="http://academia.edu/hiring" rel="nofollow">http://academia.edu/hiring</a>.<p>The kinds of things you would be working on include:<p>* building an API for Academia.edu, to allow developers to hook into our academic graph<p>* building a great News Feed for all the research you want to follow<p>* building a world class Analytics product giving scientists real-time metrics about the impact of their work<p>* building infrastructure to make the site extremely fast and stable<p>What we're looking for are:<p>* Web development experience (building apps on your own is great)<p>* Experience with the full engineering stack<p>* Passion for engineering and building great products<p>All the strategic decisions in the startup are made collaboratively, whether they are about hiring, new feature development, user growth, user retention, funding, or revenue. You can participate in those general startup decisions as much or as little as you want. We have found that our decisions are much better as a result of everyone contributing to them. If you like having an impact, you will enjoy the Academia.edu culture.

We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners/customers include Facebook, Yelp, Foursquare, Trulia, and Newsweek.<p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, deduping, storage, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you're smart and get things done, but you'll get bonus points for experience with Clojure, machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, IOS Developer. Full Time.
We’re inventing a new kind of photography for when photos just aren’t enough. Close your eyes and imagine your favourite memory - say christmas morning as a kid. You’re probably not thinking of a rectangle in a void (i.e. a picture), nor are you thinking of a moving rectangle in a void (i.e. a movie), you’re probably thinking of an entire world that you’re standing in the center of. We make an IOS app that allows you to save this entire moment into a seamless spherical photograph called a bubble that you can save and share with others.<p>We’re a small, four person team - including the intern who made Yelp’s Monocle, a designer from Cooper Union and a computer vision genius. We raised $2 million in a heavily oversubscribed round of funding from August Capital. We spoke at TED (sorry, no video!), have offices on union square in San Francisco and have an app that has an unparalleled ability to induce uncontrolled smiles of glee when people first see it.<p>We’re looking for someone to be our point person for IOS development. We actually all have IOS experience (and a really cool app in progress), but we’re looking for someone to grab the bull by the horns and focus on IOS full time (as the two engineers are focused on computer vision and ‘all the other boring engineering’ respectively). You’ll be a pretty big deal at our company. We’re pretty lucky in that our technology spans everywhere from advanced computer vision to WebGL and HTML5 to Python, PostgreSQL and Redis to low-level run-loop optimizations for UI responsiveness, multithreaded OpenGL, GCD, core data synchronization, etc. It's a lot of fun.<p>Send me an e-mail at ben@bubb.li</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4323909 href="vote?for=4323909_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%33%32%33%35%39%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4323909></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pmjoyce">pmjoyce</a> 306 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4323909">link</a></span></div><br>

We're looking for 1 or 2 product generalists who can come in and contribute the same way on Day 1. Our product is mobile first.<p>We are well funded by A-List investors.<p>We are NOT your average stealth startup. We are NOT yet another me-too-social-local-sharing app. We DON'T sell condoms by subscription. We are NOT the place to share photos of your dog taking a leak. There will be NO gamification. We are filling a hole in the universe by building software that addresses a fundamental human need. The world is becoming a different place: everyone has a network connected super computer with ambient sensors in their pockets and we can see the future that is enabled by these devices. We are making that future happen.<p>Real talk: We've been running our prototype for 2 months and we all use it every day. Every person we've showed it to has asked us if they can use it. Every single person has gotten mad when our testflights expire off their phones after letting them test it.<p>The ideal candidate is a brilliant, fearless and passionate individual who is uncompromising in his/her pursuit of building an incredible product that will positively affect the lives of millions of people every day.<p>As members of a team we believe in commitment and accountability; the importance of honing our craft; building tools to create leverage; and seeking to learn from and understand each other.<p>We are offering founding team equity and above market salary. Retina Macbook Pro _#38; 30 inch monitor. Office space in the heart of the SoMa district in beautiful San Francisco. Willing to relocate. Willing to fly in candidates for interviews. Willing to tell you our stealthy secrets.<p>Interested?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Cambridge, MA (Kendall Square)<p>Software Engineer/Senior Software Engineer at Cogo Labs (<a href="http://www.cogolabs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cogolabs.com/</a>)<p>Cogo Labs is a company that creates companies, kind of like an incubator with a twist: all of our ideas/startups come from within the company. We don't offer investment in outside startups. Thus far we have had two major ($100MM+) acquisitions, and a handful of smaller ones, and we are anticipating more in the near future. Typically, once a startup we are incubating gets off the ground, we hire employees into that startup and assist them with whatever they need to make the company successful. Cogo Labs itself has around 40 full-time employees now in our office in Kendall Square in Cambridge, MA.<p>I'm looking for a software engineer or senior software engineer to join my team. You should have a degree in CS or a similar field, and experience developing for the web, as most of our startups are web properties. Specific experience in Ruby, Rails, and/or Python are a plus, but not absolutely necessary. I'm more concerned with finding smart people than finding people with specific skills.<p>I am currently developing new features for a web site that we run that gets _#62;50k unique visitors per day, and you'd be assisting in this effort. I can be more specific if you're invited for an interview.<p>We are big on metrics and analysis -- there are grids of monitors (we call them "NOC walls") all over the office showing up-to-the-minute stats about all of our properties. I can code up a new feature, deploy it, and walk over to one of the NOC walls and literally watch my change affect traffic on the site, or revenue, or profit. It's a really fun place to work. Benefits and perks are great as well (see <a href="http://cogolabs.com/careers" rel="nofollow">http://cogolabs.com/careers</a> for more info).<p>If you're interested, shoot me an email with your resume and a brief cover letter (be sure to mention you saw this post on HN). Bonus points for including a link to your github page or other code repository where I can see some code you've written.<p>You can reach me at cmatthias at cogolabs.com.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4324466 href="vote?for=4324466_dir=up_whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%34%33%32%33%35%39%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4324466></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bentlegen">bentlegen</a> 306 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4324466">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Notting Hill, London, England.<p>Our web application is at the heart of our busy e-commerce business; every day it serves millions of product images and handles thousands of purchases - but we can and do update the live site with new code anytime we want without missing a beat. Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux, Windows, and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not. We expect developers to be generalising specialists, ready at the drop of a hat to refine an algorithm, write a tricky integration test, tune a SQL query, or discuss feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we'd like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who'd like to join us.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is one of the UK's leading private shopping clubs, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts. Brands include fashion, beauty, homewares and lifestyle categories, many familiar from the high street. The company has about 65 employees and a substantial annual turnover. The firm is growing quickly after a recent investment round.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4330271 href="vote?for=4330271_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%43%71%78%37%70%6f%6a%36%78%77%65%59%77%77%70%6d%43%6f%4f%73%34%4f"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4330271></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=seanmccann">seanmccann</a> 305 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4330271">link</a></span></div><br>

Freedom Freight is here to change that by deploying the world's first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping. Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US, without it, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In a such a massive market, it's hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines, but until now, it has. This means millions of hours are wasted and thousands of drivers are sitting idle or driving empty. We are changing that.<p>We're looking to bring Rails and iOS developers on the team. We're a small, flat company and this is a fantastic opportunity to join a great team trying to conquer one of the largest markets in the US.<p>If you think Freedom Freight would be the perfect fit, send an email with your info to sean@freedomfreightusa.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4324642 href="vote?for=4324642_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%43%71%78%37%70%6f%6a%36%78%77%65%59%77%77%70%6d%43%6f%4f%73%34%4f"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4324642></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=vide0star">vide0star</a> 306 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4324642">link</a></span></div><br>

We're the largest site I know of on Rails 3.2. We gave a presentation on the upgrade at last weeks SF Rails meetup, slides at causes.github.com/migrating-rails-talk<p>- everyone is encouraged to take one hour from their day to learn about something they wouldn't otherwise (aka study hall)<p>- every story is scoped so that it can be completed in less than a day. We don't branch, we just work on top of master. We've found that the closer we stay to master, the less needless work we create for ourselves<p>Causes is a great place to better yourself and better the world.

We analyze the data-rich domain of finance, but financial experience is not a requirement. We hope to hear from you!<p>dave.hahn@twosigma.com

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Shreveport, Louisiana - Full Time - Rails/iOS Agency<p>Twin Engine Labs - workwithus@twinenginelabs.com<p>We're an award winning, cutting edge design and engineering shop. We bootstrapped our company from two people (designer and engineer) to 11, and along the way learned a lot of lessons. A few of them are:<p>1. Building tools that make our jobs easier in the future is smart and gives our agency an edge. You will be expected to constantly try to improve our process, and your voice will be heard.<p>2. Following that point, if you think something should change? Do it. Let me know about it (CEO), get buy in from the other engineers, and don't wreck our timelines. But stop talking and start doing!<p>3. Salespeople will never estimate your project officially. Ultimately, I will bring in a project, lay it in front of you, and ask the team to do a planning poker session. Your velocity is set at a scant 10 points, and the timeline is bid against that initial velocity. Under promise, over deliver.<p>4. If you estimate poorly, you are expected to fix it. If the project just went off the rails due to things out of your control, then your feet won't be held to the fire, but if it's genuinely your fault, fix it. It's completely in your control.<p>5. Try the impossible. We built The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore, an impossible feat for it's day. We've built complex interfaces for Cisco, Symantec, and now are working with O'Reilly. Don't be afraid to use 2D Game frameworks if you have to. People don't contract Twin Engine Labs to do the status quo.<p>6. Be a full stack engineer. Know iOS but not Rails? Talk to us. Know Rails but not iOS? Talk to us. You will be placed in projects of your capacity, but very quickly ramped up to both  platforms. We expect you to know everything from server deployments to iOS deployments, to Postgres optimization to Core Data optimization, from caching in Restful APIs to caching NSURL connections. Being a full stack engineer allows you to move faster than every other shop out there.<p>7. Finally, work directly with the customer. You, as the engineer, will always be expected to speak with the customer faster than I can. I will <i>always</i> give you air cover when you need it (and I typically can see that coming from a mile away). As well, you'll hear their requirements from their mouths (no games of telephone here), and get to ask them questions, with the safety net that I always stand behind our employees.<p>Perks? Multiple projects in a year, constantly learning the cutting edge techniques, and some seriously huge names under your belt.<p>Our environment is flat. No Pointy Haired Bosses allowed or bean counters here. Paint yourself purple, turn yourself upside down, and spin around three times while you code. As long as you deliver, I don't care how you do it.<p>Employees come into work at what is a reasonable hour to them. Our employees set their own start times, with flexible work at home situations when required. Most of them come into work because... well... we like each other :)<p>Intrigued? Talk to us. We've helped multiple entrepreneurs sink funding, watched multiple apps receive awards, and are known in our region and nationally.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4323818 href="vote?for=4323818_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%43%71%78%37%70%6f%6a%36%78%77%65%59%77%77%70%6d%43%6f%4f%73%34%4f"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4323818></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=caetie">caetie</a> 306 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4323818">link</a></span></div><br>

To apply for this position, send your resume and a brief cover note to caetie@akvo.org.<p>We have some fun and hard problems to solve -- how can we maintain and extend a complex tool with a lot of moving parts (a mobile app, a web platform, map displays) while keeping it simple and enjoyable for people to use? Double down when they need to be able to use it in areas of the world with low or scarce web and mobile connectivity. How do we make the data users collect satisfying and easy to work with? Can we build web and mobile apps that can flex from an $80 off-the-shelf Android device, to a tablet, to a desktop computer? And finally, can we build FLOW to become the go-to tool for international monitoring and evaluation?<p>This is what we are looking for in a developer:<p>• You are a smart, creative and experienced Java developer who wants to learn and improve a new and complex software platform end-to-end.
• You are an independent, self-motivated worker who can also be a strong team member.
• You can see the big picture but attend diligently to the small details that make software work.
• You enjoy and value communicating your work to your team and your users.<p>Akvo is a small non-profit foundation with a big mission. We create open source web and mobile software, and build networks of skilled partners that can change the way development aid is allocated and reported. This is important, because it improves the way projects are implemented in some of the poorest parts of the world, making them more effective, efficient, sustainable and visible.<p>Core skills required:
• Java
• Web frameworks, such as Spring
• Google App Engine
• Strong database and SQL skills with knowledge of NoSQL databases
• Google Web Toolkit and Ext JS
• JavaScript/HTML/CSS/Ajax<p>Major plus skills:
• Experience developing native Android apps or other mobile phone apps (our mobile app is Android)
• Google Enterprise Technologies (Google Apps, Google Maps, Google Search) and Amazon Web Services
• JDO and other persistence technologies
• GIS software and libraries such as GeoTools
• Unit testing in Java and agile development
• Some combination of Python, Ruby, Django, Git, Lettuce, Robotium, Calabash<p>Our team is close knit, despite being distributed. We take the people and team factors very seriously, both our colleagues and our partners using our software (we call them partners and not clients). This also means that we take work-life balance and the importance of having fun very seriously. The fact that most of our developers telecommute means that you can maintain a flexible schedule and work environment to suit your needs.<p>You would work from home and expect to spend a lot of time on Skype connecting with your colleagues. It may also be possible for you to work close to colleagues in our Amsterdam, Helsinki, Stockholm or Washington DC hubs. You write and speak fluent English, and you are based in a UTC-5 to UTC+2 timezone (East Coast United States to Eastern Europe).<p>To apply for this position, send your resume and a brief cover note to caetie@akvo.org.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4323918 href="vote?for=4323918_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%43%71%78%37%70%6f%6a%36%78%77%65%59%77%77%70%6d%43%6f%4f%73%34%4f"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4323918></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jakehow">jakehow</a> 306 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4323918">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>We're hiring at Twitter (San Francisco, CA - H1B welcome).<p>My team is working on monitoring and alerting for all of the different services at Twitter. Zipkin (<a href="https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/twitter/zipkin/</a>) is an example of the kinds of tools our team is building right now. The two central components are a dashboard/charting monitoring service as well as our own alerting system.<p>Most of our infrastructure challenges stem from the sheer number of writes we need to deal with as well as the temporal nature of what we're doing - all of our writes need to happen within certain time periods and reads have to be consistent within certain time-frames to avoid engineers being woken up at 4am due to incorrect data from a dirty read. Given that we're the service which observes all the other critical components - our reliability requirements are also a huge challenge.<p>The product challenge on this team is making sense of a whole lot of data. So there is a lot of cutting-edge data visualisation work. You have certain services running on thousands of nodes and teams want to use our product to quickly find outliers and scan their dashboards with key metrics. This means you have potentially thousands of timeseries with thousands of data points on the screen at the same time. This is a JavaScript gig where you get to think about algorithms and performance on a daily basis. We're also an internal tool, so we have the option of targeting cutting edge, modern browser features. In reality it means 90% of your time is working on cool stuff and not on getting IE to work.<p>I think the biggest benefit of working on our product team is that you a level of autonomy which is hard to find on a user-facing product. So if you're the creative type who doesn't want to be micro-managed or told where to push those pixels, I think this is a really good gig.<p>Right now we're looking for experienced engineers for both infrastructure and product. Our infrastructure is JVM-based and written in Scala, with some Python. Our product is written in JavaScript and we have some Ruby to deal with. Knowledge of these platforms is beneficial, but solid experience and passion for this problem domain is even better.<p>A systems position: <a href="https://twitter.com/jobs/positions?jvi=ospeWfwL,Job" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/jobs/positions?jvi=ospeWfwL,Job</a>

Imagine a room in SF where all the top engineers from Google, Facebook, Apple, etc. come by everyday and spend a couple of hours? The value of that room is incredibly high.
Now, let's expand the room to contain the best problem solvers (hackers, PhDs, math studs from Weizmann, etc.) across the globe hanging out every single day. This room has the potential to define how the world functions.<p>At HackerRank.com we're building this room online.<p>How?
Every programmer has something that attracts her to code - bot-vs-bot contests (eg: aichallenge.org), functional programming challenges (eg: 4clojure.com), quick hacks over twitter API's, etc. This can be for fun or to learn a particular programming concept or anything in programming (eg: vimgolf.com has greatly improved my vim skills)<p>We're taking the complete experience and adding an interesting social component to it. It's going to be a fun place for programmers to hang out.<p>Team:
We're a young team at Mountain View, recently funded by Y-combinator and a top VC firm. You'll be an early engineer in a real hardworking team of hackers. Our culture is defined more on persistence than "talent".<p>Tech stack:
We use ROR, backbone.js, coffeescript, neo4j, EC2.<p>Preview: youtu.be/-p44yPm2wy0<p>Apply:

You will be joining a team of experienced front-end developers working on a wide variety of projects, both web and mobile. You will likely be hopping from project to project on a regular basis, depending on which team has the greatest need of your knowledge at any given moment. You will work closely with designers and developers to build usable and compelling interfaces. You will have many opportunities to try new things and work on the cutting edge of what's possible.<p>Who do we need?
We need someone who lives and breathes JavaScript. Our team has some experience, but we're looking for someone who writes their own plugins and relishes the challenge of writing a solution from scratch. We want someone who can help teach the rest of the team, and encourage best practices. We recognize that JS is an increasingly central component of the types of web and mobile apps we build, and we're looking for someone who can help take us to the next level.<p>Who are we?
We're not just another boring agency building brochure sites. We're a growing development shop who specializes in building compelling and usable apps using Ruby on Rails, iOS, and Android. We practice agile development, which means you'll be working closely with the client, designers, and developers at every stage, not just being handed comps and a deadline. We reward hard work and believe strongly in a sustainable work/life balance.<p>Benefits
401(K), PTO, Medical/Dental Plans, Health Savings Account. Company outings. Conferences and book budget. Creative work environment with beer-bust Fridays, game room and fully stocked kitchen onsite.<p>If you think you're the right person for the job, send your resume and examples of your work (ideally your github repo) to jobs@elctech.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4324864 href="vote?for=4324864_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%43%71%78%37%70%6f%6a%36%78%77%65%59%77%77%70%6d%43%6f%4f%73%34%4f"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4324864></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zacwitte">zacwitte</a> 306 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4324864">link</a></span></div><br>

We're building a product that changes how caregivers and providers collaborate to deliver healthcare. We're a small, polyglot team with diverse backgrounds. Our stack is Java/Scala on the back end and HTML5/CSS3/Javascript on the front end. We care deeply about aesthetics. We care deeply about coffee. We are seeking developers who are equally comfortable with front and back end development and who understand web-scale, high-availability, high-traffic application architectures.<p>We're looking to bring on a top-notch software engineer, a pragmatist focused on shipping. We are open to contract or full-time work candidates. You will play a role in shaping this product -- this is core to our culture, so bring your opinions. We're generalists, but the path we're blazing will heavily rely on Javascript, jQuery, Backbone.js, HTML5, CSS3, Java, Scala, Play Framework, and Amazon Web Services. We're web first but mobile is quickly approaching on the horizon. Bonus points if you have experience working with medical informatics.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Berlin, Germany ("H1B") - StorageRoom - iOS<p>We’re building a cloud-based Content Management platform that’s targeted at developers. We just received funding from prestigious VCs (unannounced).<p>You say Content Management sucks? That’s exactly what we think, and we see a huge opportunity to do something completely different that plays well with HTML5/JS and native mobile apps.
The initial version of our platform is already used by hundreds of customers, from major global media companies to small development agencies.<p>It’s now time to throw away the prototype of our API and to build a high-performance solution, from scratch. We already have a team for the backend and are now looking for an iOS developer who will create an iOS SDK and example applications.<p>We’re looking for someone who already has a solid experience in writing and testing iOS applications and that has a good knowledge of the iOS ecosystem and its frameworks (CoreData etc.). You should have a good Computer Science foundation and an authentic interest in working with Objective-C and Cocoa. One of the main jobs besides developing will be to involve the iOS community with talks at conferences and interesting prototypes.<p>Interested? Please send your GitHub account and any other interesting links about you to sascha@thriventures.com.<p>P.S.: The only language in the company is English and living in Berlin without any knowledge of German isn't a problem at all.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4327743 href="vote?for=4327743_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%69%47%54%4f%74%75%74%37%32%32%46%39%45%4c%62%7a%6a%4c%7a%51%56%64"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4327743></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wferrell">wferrell</a> 306 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4327743">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Guildford, UK<p>MyDrive Solutions<p><i>Who are we?</i><p>MyDrive provides data analysis services for insurance telematics. We collect GPS data from black boxes installed in cars, and from smartphone apps, and we analyse it to work out how well you are driving, so insurers can provide a fair price for insurance. This means that good drivers can get cheaper car insurance. We work with RoSPA in the UK for driver behavioural research into what constitutes good driving. We have customers and commercial pilots across Europe and South Africa with a range of global insurance companies, brokers and aggregators.<p>Our processing engine is predominantly Ruby 1.9, with a Rails (3.2, rspec, cucumber etc) API frontend backed by Postgres. Redis and Resque power the processing queue, and we occasionally drop down to C++ for some number crunching (normally libs wrapped up in FFI Ruby bindings).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Location: San Francisco (North Beach/Jackson Square)<p>Job Title: Front-end developer using Rails 3.2, slim, coffee script, jquery. Ember.js is a plus.<p>AFAR Media is a well-funded travel media start-up spanning print and web. We have big monitors, stand-up desks, and fancy new laptops.  Your coworkers will be be developers, designers, project mangers, and (this is the cool part) magazine editors, meaning you'll work with a wider ranger of personalities than the standard developer scrum.<p>This job is ideal for someone who loves to travel for fun (the position does not require travel, but a fulfilling life does, and one of our great perks is a yearly travel stipend). No arbitrary requirements here, if you are an expert or a least have a hacking willingness to learn and 
a good attitude, we want you. Our team is small, and all opinions are considered (and frankly, needed) from product design through delivery.<p>If you are interested, please send an email to jobs@afar.com.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_4350141 href="vote?for=4350141_dir=up_whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%42%62%69%4b%6b%66%71%72%7a%31%6d%48%72%68%54%55%66%38%46%71%78%50"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_4350141></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rileycrane">rileycrane</a> 300 days ago  | <a href="item?id=4350141">link</a></span></div><br>
