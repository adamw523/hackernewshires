<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">We_#x27;re an office culture. We_#x27;re constantly getting into situations where we hit technical challenges we haven_#x27;t solved before, but someone else in the office has. Several times a day you_#x27;ll see people crowd around someone_#x27;s computer trying to work through some bug or misbehavior to see if we can, as a group, turn it into something exploitable. That_#x27;s reason #1.<p>Reason #2 is fairness. Some of our work is on-site. We arrange our offices so that we have _quot;house accounts_quot; in Chicago, NYC, and SFBA, and on any given day some fraction of the office is likely to be at one of those places. All things being equal, people would like to work from their own office instead of someone else_#x27;s. If we pick up remote people, those people will by definition not be able to staff on-site projects, which mean that the people who actually come to the office will get stuck with that work.<p>Reason #3 is that reasons #1 and #2 have been dispositive for us since 2005, and so we have a management structure tuned to that office culture. We_#x27;re not set up to manage remote team members. We_#x27;re especially concerned about this because some of us have experience working on assessment teams at _quot;work from home_quot; firms, and have seen wildly uneven results from projects managed like that. We_#x27;re paranoid about quality and consistency the way a fine dining restaurant is paranoid about the consistency of dishes coming out of the kitchen.<p>I_#x27;m not saying that there_#x27;s necessarily anything bad about remote_#x2F;WFH cultures, or that you couldn_#x27;t build a good assessment firm doing remote_#x2F;WFH. I_#x27;m just saying we haven_#x27;t done it. :)</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="120"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7692316" href="vote?for=7692316_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%37%39%34%33%31"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7692316"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=elbear">elbear</a> 80 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7692316">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;re trying to do something legitimately new here, so first, some background: Right now, building a mobile app means:<p>1 (optional): Try to build a crappy version using non-native platform technologies like: HTML5, Titanium, PhoneGap, or some other solution that attempts to use or translate the web way (HTML_#x2F;JS) to mobile.<p>2: Spend a lot of time and money building your mobile app from scratch using native API (Cocoa_#x2F;Android)<p>Apart from the pain induced when you try to do (1) before (2), this is fine if you_#x27;re building a complex or involved app that merits significant and dedicated time and money for development.<p>But, at Propeller, we think there is great demand for the ability to build simple mobile apps (which is why tools for (1) exist.) But, (1) sucks - it_#x27;s not native, or it_#x27;s native translated from web technologies, and becomes unnecessarily complicated. Method (2) works, but it_#x27;s incredibly expensive because everything is being built from scratch.<p>HTML_#x2F;JS was a great idea when shipping code was difficult, and users didn_#x27;t want to install software. Everyone had a runtime already (the browser), and so simple applications were built on that platform.  First just with HTML (the _lt;form_gt; element) and then HTML+JS for clients that were called _quot;rich_quot; but just needed to do things HTML forms couldn_#x27;t do.<p>But taking this model and attempting to make it work on mobile is not only bad engineering, it_#x27;s misguided! This model makes sense when you can_#x27;t ship actual code to your users, but Apple changed all that by inventing[1] the App Store (straightforward) and getting users to trust it (really a big deal.) This removes the distribution problem.  Users will install your software, so you don_#x27;t need to target a legacy distribution stack that was originally designed for sharing documents and a really weird language with so many quirks a book title _quot;The Good Parts_quot; had to be written.  It_#x27;s bad engineering motivated by decisions which aren_#x27;t relevant anymore. Building mobile applications on top of (or translated from) a legacy stack with so many workarounds, shims, libraries on top of libraries, Shadow DOMs, cross-browser compatibility, compile-to-JS, minification, XSS protections, and so on is just crazy.<p>HTML_#x2F;JS on mobile will always suck and will always play catch-up because it_#x27;s built on a legacy foundation. Hell, it sucks on the desktop now too. We put up with it because the alternative isn_#x27;t feasible.<p>_lt;_#x2F;rant_gt;<p>But, there is another way! There are good ideas here.<p>Shipping code (and waiting for Apple to approve it) brings us back to the days when we had to release major versions and burn them to CDs and put them in boxes. It_#x27;s un-agile. Developers love writing web apps because it_#x27;s agile - they can change their application, deploy, and release their fix or feature very quickly. That_#x27;s invaluable and should not be impossible on mobile. [2] So, our hypothesis is that there are a class of simple mobile apps whose behavior can be described declaratively using a simple JSON format that can be hosted statically, or delivered piecemeal as needed, or even generated dynamically a la a REST API. It could describe an app UI directly, and also how it interacts with a server API, and it could be rendered using native controls.<p>Think Web apps, but instead of a legacy stack that wasn_#x27;t designed for application development, a simpler and more straightforward format uniquely suited and designed for modern Internet_#x2F;Web applications, taking into consideration all of the things we_#x27;ve learned a modern Internet application needs.<p>Right now we_#x27;re building (and shipping) sophisticated apps that are defined by our JSON format and rendered using 100% native controls on iOS and Android. We can update that JSON at any time to change the app on next launch. We can send down new JSON via an AJAX-like mechanism.  We_#x27;re iterating on the format_#x2F;protocol, and shipping new version of the client. We_#x27;re figuring stuff out around client-side views, realtime client_lt;-_gt;server communication, data sync in general, and many other interesting things. There are enormous problems to be solved here, both engineering-wise and in API_#x2F;Protocol_#x2F;Architecture design.<p>YOU: are an interested hacker who isn_#x27;t content to let people build shoddy applications on a gross legacy stack, or invest way too much time and money for things that really should be a lot easier. We_#x27;re looking for someone who realizes all these pain points and isn_#x27;t afraid to imagine how things should be done. Think: in 10 years, will people really be building new apps on HTML? No. Come help us design the stack of the future. Ideally, you have experience in iOS and Android, since that_#x27;s our most pressing need right now and likely in the future.<p>US: a 3-person team (two co-founders and myself) trying to modernize (mobile) application development. We run Rails_#x2F;Postgres_#x2F;Sidekiq on the backend for the apps we host for our users, but our clients consume JSON so that_#x27;s an implementation detail. In the future people can generate that JSON using any backend they want. Our iOS application is in Ruby (via RubyMotion, which has worked well for us) and some ObjC, and our Android client is in Java. We share some code between them (like our layout engine) and we want to share more. We_#x27;ve taken a seed round from some great investors[3]. 
We_#x27;re very small still, so your impact would be immense.<p>EMAIL: jobs@usepropeller.com (I_#x27;m ben@usepropeller.com)<p>1: Yes, I remember Linspire. I_#x27;m using _quot;invent_quot; loosely here.<p>2: Apple doesn_#x27;t let you actually ship code (or, technically speaking, an interpreter, you can ship JS) but many client-side interactions don_#x27;t actually need to be re-implemented every time. HTML forms are an example: client-side interactivity without custom logic. There are many other interactions that can be abstracted this way, especially on mobile, where user interactions are more constrained, and especially for stuff that just updates the UI and can be solved using a Reactive_#x2F;Data Flow approach.<p>3: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/06/27/propeller-gets-1-25m-from-a16z-ffangel-everyone-good-basically/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;techcrunch.com_#x2F;2013_#x2F;06_#x2F;27_#x2F;propeller-gets-1-25m-from-a...</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7680063" href="vote?for=7680063_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%37%39%34%33%31"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7680063"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=spicyj">spicyj</a> 82 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7680063">link</a></span></div><br>

Today, I am 13 and wrapping up my second semester of it, and with an A+, too, thanks largely in part to this site. Sal, I would say you are the best teacher I ever had. Teachers in school just don_#x27;t seem to have the time or, in some cases, even the knowledge to pay as much attention as you do to the actual intuition of the material being taught. How am I supposed to understand a theorem if I don_#x27;t know where it came from, why it works, or even what it really means? Khan Academy also seems to explain everything in a very easy to understand, and even fun, manor. You make calculus almost as easy as simple arithmetic. Anyway, thank you very much.<p>==================================<p>Every month we get hundreds of letters like this from people in all walks of life who_#x27;re thankful for our free, high-quality educational content.
Most of you reading this are familiar with Sal_#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers, partnerships with organizations like MoMA and the California Academy of Sciences, and a huge library of interactive exercises. Over 20 million math problems are done every week on our site.<p>You_#x27;ll be part of a small team working alongside both _quot;celebrity_quot; devs (like jQuery creator John Resig and Google_#x27;s first employee Craig Silverstein) and many more who you haven_#x27;t heard of but who are also really awesome.<p>Apply at <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/careers" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.khanacademy.org_#x2F;careers</a> and be sure to mention that you_#x27;re coming from HN.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Clever (YC S12) is hiring full-stack engineers in San Francisco to hack education<p>Steve Jobs described education as one of the final frontiers still untouched by modern technology. Clever (<a href="https://getclever.com" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;getclever.com</a>) is building the data platform needed for great software to make its way into the classroom. Just like Stripe has made it simple for developers to build payment processing into their apps, Clever has made it easy for developers to build applications for schools using student data.<p>We_#x27;re a small team of highly technical hackers with deep experience in education. Since releasing the Clever APIs in 2012, we_#x27;ve signed up the most innovative education companies as partners and deployed our platform to 1 in every 7 schools in America.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Academia.edu  |  Downtown San Francisco  |  Full Time Engineers  |  Relocation Available<p>Academia.edu is an agile startup located in San Francisco on Kearny and Bush Street.  Our CEO is Richard Price who received his PhD from Oxford in Philosophy and is an avid sailor.  Our team is also led by CTO Ben Lund who is not only a great technical leader, but also an amazing foosball player.<p>We are well-funded by Khosla Ventures and we are on a mission to Open Science.  Our goal as a company is to build an end-to-end publication system that provides the world with free and accessible academic and scientific papers.  So far we have 9,364,002 users.<p>Feel free to check out the technical projects that our engineers are tackling (see below) or visit our hiring page at <a href="https://www.academia.edu/hiring" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.academia.edu_#x2F;hiring</a> to learn more about us.  We look forward to hearing from you.<p>We are Hiring a Team to Build a Better Future<p>Here at Academia.edu you will have an opportunity to join an agile team of 9 Engineers who are all making a positive impact on the world by contributing to a movement called Open Science.  As a member of our team you will be given a lot of autonomy to choose projects that interest you the most and the ability to make product decisions with our CTO Ben Lund and CEO Richard Price.<p>We are currently tackling five incredibly difficult product challenges.  Some of these projects have been attempted by larger companies and have failed.  In order to be successful we will need to think way outside-of-the-box and take a leap into the unknown…<p>Peer Review<p>We want to build a peer review platform that allows layers of discussion on top of a single document.  One of the biggest challenges we face is that contextual commenting at a large scale has yet to be achieved.  In order to be successful we need to find original and novel solutions because simple approaches like putting a blog-style comment box at the end of the paper has been tried before and has not been effective.<p>To build Peer Review we must figure out a way to transform all the wide array of styles from any given PDF paper to a clean and consistent format that is embedded for a suitable commenting UI.  We are experimenting to build a rich inline-commenting and discussion interface as well as a reputation system that surfaces quality comments.<p>Interface Design<p>We currently have 7.5 million users who upload their research papers.  Academia converts these PDFs to HTLM5 to display in the browser.  We face the challenges of building web UIs for scientific content such as 3D molecular visualizations and tools for exploring genetic sequences.  We will also build back-end parsers, converters, and storage schemes to enable these UIs.<p>Recommendation Engine<p>We have a news feed that displays recommended papers to our users.  Currently we use a simple rule-based system where papers are tagged by research interests and our users can follow those research interests.  In addition, our users can follow each other.  We want our users to feel as if they are attending an amazing conference where everything we show them is the most relevant and up-to-date information that is available in their field.<p>In order to improve our recommendation engine, we will be immersed in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  We want to identify which particular field of the paper it correlates to (math, biochemistry, anthropology, etc.) and the type of document (original research, a review article, a conference presentation, a lecture note or some other content).  Using everything from a paper’s previous viewers on Academia.edu to its author and content to its place in the citation graph, we want to determine the relevance of a particular document to a particular user.  Lastly, using large-scale data analysis we want to identify trending papers, highlight influential researchers and help the public uncover important new work more quickly and reliably.<p>Mobile App<p>Academia does not have a mobile app but we are dedicated to building one!<p>Working with a clean slate, we will design and build a mobile API that displays Academia’s core features.  These features will include the user profile, upload papers, news feed, analytic data, and the ability to make comments on papers (Peer Review).  In order to build a dynamic mobile API, we will write easy-to-use client libraries in a wide range of scripting languages that will encourage integration with Academia’s data, content and identity into their apps.<p>Speed, Scale, _amp; Storage<p>Our engineering team will have to build highly scalable systems that effectively store and analyze our entire stream of hits.  We have built an analytics dashboard so that every user can see how many people viewed their profile and how many people have read their uploaded papers.  We enabled this feature by storing structured data in DynamoDB- currently 343 million rows and growing 10% per month.  We want to build features that require more sophisticated aggregations on this data than DynamoDB can provide.<p>Furthermore we will need to figure out how to effectively store massive amounts of data while increasing the speed of our product especially to parts of the world where there is slower internet connections.  This is important because areas in the world with slower connections tend to be where researchers can benefit the most from open access to research.  Our platform must be useable for them too.<p>Future at Academia.edu<p>We have a fun and agile team and we are growing (our site usage grows 10% per month)!  We have the resources to make our mission come true.  We just raised $11 million from Khosla Ventures, Spark Capital, and True Ventures.<p>Apply<p>If you think you would be interested in solving some of these technical problems, then please do not hesitate to contact ashley@academia.edu.  Or if you are interested in chatting with our CEO Richard or meeting the team for a game of foosball, then let us know as you are more than welcome to drop by our office in Downtown San Francisco.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7680644" href="vote?for=7680644_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%37%39%34%33%31"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7680644"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dpapathanasiou">dpapathanasiou</a> 82 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7680644">link</a></span></div><br>

Each dish is prepared using local ingredients and healthier recipes, providing not-so-greasy versions of your _quot;go to_quot; takeout options. Our dishes are inspired by the individuality, creativity and cultural heritage of our chefs from around the globe. From Dragon Rolls to Braised Brisket, Gobble has something healthy and exciting for everyone. Local families absolutely love the service so far (4.5 stars on Yelp!), and we_#x27;re only just getting started.<p><i>Bay Area Community Manager</i><p>Calling all aspiring and veteran community managers who love cooking and learning about food! We are looking for someone who can be the voice of our exciting company and help us best communicate with our customers.<p>Now, this is where you come in... Our operations are up and running, and it_#x27;s time to go beyond doing the bare minimum. We need a smart, energetic team player to join our team of five as the first ever Gobble Community Manager.<p>We know this title usually suggests some kind of social media management, but this role goes way beyond that. When we say community manager, we mean that you will be the person who represents who we are to the outside world. You will also be responsible for bringing outside input to our team to help us continually improve our product. We want someone who can sit at the team meetings with us as an equal with the founders and really think about what we want to communicate to customers and how we can do better.<p>The kinds of things you_#x27;ll be doing are endless, but here_#x27;s a starter list of duties:<p>* Customer happiness - you will be talking directly with customers every day and making sure they_#x27;re happy with our product. If they_#x27;re not, you_#x27;ll also be the one to help us fix that. You will be the frontline of defense when it comes to making sure we are attending to customers_#x27; needs.<p>* Writing our weekly newsletter - this is our one source of outgoing communication so it_#x27;s pretty important to make sure it conveys exciting product updates and food world content that aligns spot on with our company values.<p>* Incorporating customer feedback into the product - You_#x27;ll be the one hearing all their feedback and making sure we can turn it into actionable product changes.<p>* Whatever occurs to you and whatever comes your way. You are joining an early early stage startup so we expect you to figure out what needs to get done so that we can successfully communicate with our clients and implement it as needed. We also expect you to be flexible and take on any necessary tasks that might not fit your job description.<p><i>Requirements:</i><p>* A bachelor_#x27;s degree. If you don_#x27;t have one, feel free to convince us of why you_#x27;re still a fit.
Team spirit. Have we mentioned we_#x27;re a tight-knit group? We want someone who wants to be part of a team and is a good team played and contributor.<p>* Willingness to dive in. We_#x27;re not looking for someone who wants a 9-5 job. This is just not what that is! We want someone who will join us and think and act like a company founder.
Precision. We_#x27;re a team that doesn_#x27;t miss a detail or a beat. You should be highly organized and 100% on your game at all times.<p>* Previous experience in a writing role. Whether it_#x27;s newsletters, emails, blog posts, or your college newspaper, you can quickly create content for our customers that is both creative and clear.
Previous experience in a people-facing role. Maybe you worked at an ice cream store one summer, or you worked in communications at a non-profit, or you made sales calls for a past startup. Grace under pressure is the key to success here.<p>* Excitement to join an early-stage company. Early-stage companies are a world of their own. They_#x27;re small and hectic, and it takes someone who loves this environment to succeed in it.
Experience working at a startup is preferred, but not required. It would be helpful if you_#x27;ve been in this environment before and know what it_#x27;s about.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7680304" href="vote?for=7680304_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%37%39%34%33%31"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7680304"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=StuieK">StuieK</a> 82 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7680304">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Full-time in Chicago - Front-end Engineer<p>ThreadMeUp - <a href="https://www.threadmeup.com" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.threadmeup.com</a><p>Who we are and where we_#x27;re at<p>We’re an ambitious, funded startup hellbent on creating the ultimate custom apparel platform for designing, ordering, and crowdfunding. We are extremely dedicated to the quality of our web application. We will cut no corners and spare no expense to blow away all expectations and provide our users with an absolutely outstanding experience. We have a functional application that is already pushing orders, but we built it in a bootstrapped state, and have a much more ambitious vision for its future.<p>What we’re looking for<p>We need a true engineer to really take over the front-end of our web application and work together with us in a highly agile environment, onsite in our Chicago office. Before we were funded, our creative director did the whole front-end, but that was a temporary solution. We’re going to be rebuilding our platform, and we need your expertise on our team to produce a maintainable, flexible, scalable front-end, and continually improve our product into the future.<p>Why you might like being on our team<p>We respect your expertise: we will present you with the problem rather than the solution.
We care about being cutting-edge: we want you to explore new tools and technology.
We give you ownership of your work: for all things front-end, your word is gospel.
There’s no dead weight to carry: just like you, your teammates are experts in their own right. This means the product we create will be stunning.
We won’t control your hours: we only see progress, not time you’re in or out, just be integrated with the team and generally present.
You don’t have to be secretive: we want to win awwwards and be involved in the community.
Our creative director can do the meticulously tweaked to perfection CSS for visuals_#x2F;motion himself, instead of bugging you to move things over a few pixels.
Where you would fit into the team<p>Primarily, you’d be forming a dynamic duo (neither of you has to be Robin it’s cool) with our creative director (see <a href="http://isaacpvl.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;isaacpvl.com</a> ) The two of you are responsible for everything our visitors see and feel, which is paramount to us. You’d have the opportunity to be part of the design process not just where it pertains to technology, but also to user experience. You’d also be highly involved with our CTO and lead software engineer, who are responsible for the back-end. We’d all be coming together to build, launch, and constantly improve, so transparency and integration within the team is a must.<p>The list of stuff<p>You have strong, dearly-held philosophies about proper organization and structure of client-side code.
You are well versed in JavaScript frameworks (like AngularJS,) and have an opinion you could back-up on which one you would use based on the situation.
The same goes for CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap 3.)
You have a fundamental understanding of software development, and web application architecture and design patterns.
You can effectively collaborate with the design process and quickly iterate based on the feedback it responds to.
You don’t just grasp the big picture, you have a vision for how you could make it better and want to be in a position to make that a reality.
You strive for the results of your work to be nothing short of stunning (and you want to be on the front page of awwwards.)<p>Compensation is negotiable but you can expect to paid competitively.<p>Just shoot our CTO an email introducing yourself!

shared web pages every day, automatically classify them into tens of thousands
of topics, and serve up personalized feeds in real-time using our homegrown,
lightning fast, machine learning-based relevance engine.  We are looking to
grow our top-notch team, with both junior and senior-level positions available.<p>We are looking for engineers with deep interest and knowledge in at least one
area core to our business (i.e., distributed systems, ops and tooling, machine
learning, designing and building new product features). We’re a small team, so
you will have the opportunity to have a lot of impact, and to learn from peers
who are extremely talented engineers, computer scientists, and data experts.
Our backend is written entirely in Clojure, a JVM-based LISP that is a dream to
work in. Almost none of us knew it before we joined, and we don’t expect you to
either. We do, however, expect the following:<p>- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess.<p>- You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs.<p>- You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful.<p>- You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two.<p>- You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are.<p>- You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.<p>Here’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:<p>- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive<p>- Building out new product features in our API<p>- Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly<p>- Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more<p>- Creating tools to assist development and ops<p>- Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7679432" href="vote?for=7679432_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%36%37%39%34%33%31"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7679432"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sokratisp">sokratisp</a> 82 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7679432">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">San Francisco, CA - Front Row is hiring a generalist web engineer to join our high-growth, high-impact education startup. Email jobs@frontrowed.com<p>The business
Front Row makes educational applications for students, teachers and principals that help them make data-driven decisions. As of today, more than a hundred thousand students have signed-up for Front Row and used it to receive custom-tailored guidance in their learning. Thousands of teachers use Front Row every day to save hours of time and make sure their students are growing at the fastest rate achievable. Front Row active users have been growing 100% a month for the past 6 months.<p>Front Row is successfully venture-funded and on the road to profitability.<p>As one of our very first engineers, you will be part of a team of developers who are passionate about their vocation, take pride in their craft and who push each other to grow as professionals. You will strive for pragmatism and 80_#x2F;20 in your work. You will be using tools that provide you with the most leverage and make you most effective. By working really smart, you will produce more than the average developer ever will, but without the crazy hours.<p>We love generalists who can quickly bring themselves up to speed with any technology we’re using: you will have the chance to learn a lot, and fast too. You will receive continuous support and mentorship on your journey to achieving mastery. We do however expect you not to need to be hand-held and rely on others for your own growth. You will have full autonomy over your work.<p>You must not be a drama queen, nor a brilliant jerk: your development chops alone will not cut it. You will work in an effective team that plans, executes and reflects together.
Because we’re a small team, everything you create will go into production and be used by hundreds of thousands of students. You will never do unimportant work: every contribution will make a clear and tangible impact on the company’s trajectory. Your personal success will be directly aligned with that of the company.<p>Most importantly, your work will have purpose: Front Row is a mission-driven company that takes pride in making a significant impact in the lives of thousands of students.<p>Tools
Front Row is a polyglot combination of multiple web applications, mobile apps and asset generation tools. The front-end uses Backbone.js, several plugins and grunt.js for automation. The backend is predominantly made of Clojure-based app talking to PostgreSQL. Our tooling is a mix of Ruby scripts and Haskell apps. Operations relies on Ansible and Vagrant, with AWS for hosting.<p>Nice-to-haves
You have worked at a startup before
You have worked in small and effective Agile_#x2F;XP teams before
You have delivered working software to large numbers of users before
You are fluent in functional programming
You have a strong understanding of full-stack development, and are comfortable jumping from the front-end back to the DB if need be.<p>Front Row - our mission<p>It_#x27;s a sad reality that students from poorer families perform worse in school than students from wealthier families. Part of this reason has to do with home environment and absentee parents, but much of it has to do with inferior resources and less experienced teachers. The worst part of this problem is that if a student falls behind in any grade, they will forever be behind in every grade. So even if the probability of falling behind in 3rd grade is low (it isn_#x27;t), the probability of falling behind in 3rd grade or 4th grade or 5th grade (and so on) is really high.<p>That_#x27;s the core problem Front Row solves - it doesn_#x27;t let students fall behind. And if they fall behind, it catches them up really quickly. And it does this even if the teacher isn_#x27;t very good (although better teachers always help). Now, the probability of falling behind in any given grade is irrelevant, because it will never compound. The student who would have been the most at risk will instead be up to speed, and therefore far more motivated.<p>Email jobs@frontrowed.com to tell us a bit about yourself if you would like to apply.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7679473" href="vote?for=7679473_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%79%4b%5a%48%6c%5a%38%4f%59%6c%75%66%59%45%39%4c%62%65%6e%6e%54%75"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7679473"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=cryptoz">cryptoz</a> 82 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7679473">link</a></span></div><br>

We specialize in web application development but look for well-rounded application developers. If you are a solid programmer and a team player, this is an opportunity for you. Even if you don_#x27;t have experience with everything listed in this ad, we offer excellent learning opportunities for those who are eager to expand their skill sets. Job Responsibilities<p>Working in small development teams, programmers participate in the architecture, design, and implementation of primarily Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and PHP code to meet client requirements for robust, high-performance, and secure sites and applications. Developers get exposure to several client projects and a variety of technologies over time. Job Qualifications<p>In addition to overall programming capability, candidates must have experience working on collaborative development teams and very strong communication skills. While we employ and enjoy the company of extroverts and introverts alike, we reiterate that the ability to communicate clearly is a must-have for our technical staff. That means writing professional e-mails and interpreting the nuances of clients_#x27; requirements by asking good questions, for example.<p>We work hard to estimate projects accurately so that schedules are reasonable and developers work a normal amount of hours per week. We rely on developers to contribute to those estimates and provide feedback as a project goes along to keep things on track.<p>Ideal candidates will have experience building all facets of software systems including the data model, business logic, and front-end. 3+ years of object-oriented design and development in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby is desired. On the front-end, HTML 5 and CSS experience is required.<p>Knowledge of some or all of the following specific tools and technologies is a plus:<p><pre><code>    Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP
    Tools: Continuous Integration (Jenkins, Hudson, etc.), static code analysis (Sonar, etc.), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven
    Web: vert.x, Play, Spring, Django, Rails, node.js, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.
    Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile or similar
    Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), cloud servers, Linux configuration, application servers (Resin, etc.)
    Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, Oracle, NoSQL (CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.) 
</code></pre>
We like technical people who are not afraid to have strong opinions about technology but simultaneously keep an open mind and are flexible enough to work with whatever technology the task at hand requires.<p>That said, we_#x27;re mostly looking for great developers who are great to work with. If you don_#x27;t have experience with everything listed above (and who does?) but are still a solid developer eager to learn new things, you might be a great fit here.<p>Please apply here: <a href="http://jobs.techempower.com/hn" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;jobs.techempower.com_#x2F;hn</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7734602" href="vote?for=7734602_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%79%4b%5a%48%6c%5a%38%4f%59%6c%75%66%59%45%39%4c%62%65%6e%6e%54%75"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7734602"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=maramartin">maramartin</a> 71 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7734602">link</a></span></div><br>

Having a need to find people to buy our designs, we turned to social media. It ended up being a great customer acquisition channel.

Oh, you probably should be a product designer (visual_#x2F;ux) or a developer (iOS_#x2F;Android_#x2F;Rails)<p>What a typical day looks like:<p>Hanging out with DJs and musicians that come by for customer development. Startups come by too, but it_#x27;s much more fun having impromptu dance parties with emerging artists ;) You_#x27;ll probably dance while you code too. We love life and enjoy every moment of it.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do _quot;expense reports that don_#x27;t suck!_quot; (Google _quot;expensify_quot; to read more.) We_#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren_#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it_#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won_#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn_#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We_#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We_#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing_#x2F;designing_#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you_#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you_#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you_#x27;re this sort of person, you_#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn_#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That_#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it_#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I_#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don_#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href="http://we.are.expensify.com/apply" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;we.are.expensify.com_#x2F;apply</a>).

Managing this team requires knowledge of code to assist in architecture decisions and reviews, an interest in the market, to help prioritize the tactical work and promote long term strategic returns, and the desire to have a seat at the table when the big decisions are made.  This is not a job around quick band-aids and calming the customer, this is a job around getting ahead of the curve and pushing code, process, and policy to bring relief.  I’m looking for a planner, not a mechanic!

You’re a come up with mind-blowing solutions to complex problems.
You get excited over new technology and have to play with it right away.  
You test, refactor, and love your code.  
You write killer back-end code, but don’t shy away from the front-end.<p>Who are we?
Before any meeting, Charlie automatically researches people before you see them.  Researching people is a complex problem: we sift through, analyze, and manipulate data into powerful insights (i.e. what are they passionate about, what do you have in common?).  CNBC called us “One of the world’s most promising new companies” and SXSW selected us as an Accelerator Finalist.<p>We’ve built Charlie to research people at massive scale, using the latest Ruby on Rails stack with MongoDB, Redis, Sidekiq, and hosted in an elastic cloud farm.  We write code with agility and have a tight process where anyone on the team can deploy to production at any time, without approval.  We thoroughly test our code, though we’re not strict TDD.  We_#x27;re a small dev that loves to code, and constantly pushes, and learns from each other.<p>This is your opportunity to join an early-stage company that’s making moves.  Sound interesting?  Let us know what makes you the perfect candidate.<p>Why we’re special:
   * Flexible working situation: hours, location
   * Competitive salary + equity
   * Funded startup backed by some amazing people
   * Everyone deploys to production (fully automated, painless)
   * We go out and do fun things (concerts, Bulls _amp; Cubs games, and occasionally ski in Colorado)<p>Requirements:
   * Full-stack developer (heavy back-end)
   * Ruby on Rails preferred, but you can learn.
   * DB experience (SQL or NoSQL?)
   * Not afraid of the front-end (HTML5, jQuery, Coffeescript, bootstrap, Sass, Slim)
   * Test your code (Rspec, capybara, cucumber, etc)
   * Hobbyist: Working on a side project to learn new technology?
   * Creative problem solver
   * Git _#x2F; Github
   * Smart _amp; gets things done.<p>Location

Neither are we! But we are interested in having fun and building cool software.<p>FlareWorks is a mobile messaging startup headquartered in San Francisco, California. Our mission is to build a platform for contextual communication between family and friends that is easier, simpler and safer than texting. Our company’s visual messaging service —called Flares— uses visual cues, instead of text, to provide communication shortcuts between friends and family.<p>We_#x27;re a seed funded, VERY early stage startup, so this is an opportunity to get in on the ground-floor ( we have not launched yet ). You would be engineer number 2 or 3. We_#x27;re looking for mobile developers, both iOS and Android to help us take our application and platform to the next level. Our mobile apps are the face of the organization and, as such, you’ll be on the front lines of creating an application and experience that has the potential to be used by millions of people every day.<p>Our Stack:<p><pre><code>  * Node for our API.
  * Erlang for our platform.
</code></pre>
What we offer:<p><pre><code>  * We_#x27;re not fans of 9-5 with a lunch break. Work then you want, where you want. Results matter. _quot;Seat Time_quot; does not.
  * Unlimited PTO. Take the time off you need, when you need it. We don_#x27;t offer prizes for _#x27;attendance_#x27;.
  * 5K equipment budget. Buy what you want; After a year, it_#x27;s yours to keep.
  * Company outings. We like to get out and do things as a team. Lunches, dinners, games, volunteering, concerts. We_#x27;re always on the lookout for things to do.
  * A real voice. We want to know what you think. If you have an idea or think something isn_#x27;t working, we want to hear about it. Your voice counts.
  * Generous options and an actually competitive salary ( no low balling + options bait and switch here ).
  * 
</code></pre>
What we_#x27;re looking for:<p><pre><code>  * Senior level Android and iOS engineers.
  * UX and visual design chops.
  * Meticulous attention to details.
  * Android:
    * Animation and the hardware accelerated rendeing pipeline as well as OpenGL ES.
    * Location, Content and Media SDK experience.
  * iOS:
    * Core Graphics, Core Animation, Core Data, Core Location
  * Comfort with rapid iteration and real-time team collaboration.
</code></pre>
We_#x27;re hoping for local talent for our first hires, but are open to the possibility of remote for the right person.<p>If this sounds like a good fit for you, email us (jobs@flareworks.co) and we_#x27;ll talk.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7680823" href="vote?for=7680823_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%79%4b%5a%48%6c%5a%38%4f%59%6c%75%66%59%45%39%4c%62%65%6e%6e%54%75"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7680823"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=blakecaldwell">blakecaldwell</a> 82 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7680823">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Noom - NYC (Chelsea)<p>Noom is a health and wellness software company building mobile applications that have been downloaded over 20 million times worldwide. The company is fully committed to creating beautiful and functional products that enable users to live better and healthier lives. Noom’s headquarters is a spacious and bright gallery building in Chelsea, where ‘Noomers’ enjoy free daily gourmet lunches prepared by their in-house chef. Noom recently received a significant investment round and needs to expand their engineering team.<p>Noom’s Engineering Culture<p>Noom engineers are expected to contribute to a variety of projects, so it is not uncommon to work on the iOS or Android clients one week and the Python and Tomcat servers the next. Engineering efforts are broken into missions that generally last 4-6 months, with teams that may include cross-functional members from product and design. Once a mission is complete, engineers transition to a new mission which is likely to include an entirely new set of technologies. Noom practices include continuous build process, regular code reviews, and weekly deployments. Noom engineering moves fast – this means they always use the best tools for the job, or build them if necessary.<p>Their stack includes Nginx, Spring MVC, mySQL, and MongoDB for web and a hybrid approach with native Android and iOS SDK’s in Java and Objective-C mixed with HTML5 where appropriate.<p>The company is currently seeking Senior Engineers as well as Senior Designers (for both web and mobile).<p>Noom is a close group with a family feel. All Noomers receive 100% company-paid health insurance, $200 monthly health and wellness stipends, and a $700 annual gadget budget. The company offers flexible work schedules, stock options, competitive salaries, substantial paid time-off, and the opportunity to work with a skilled team making a difference. The company was named by Crain’s New York as a Best Place to Work in 2013.<p>apply to dave@fecak.com</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7680976" href="vote?for=7680976_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4d%4e%4c%4d%65%6e%74%49%48%41%50%6b%31%47%4d%69%41%48%74%55%4b%66"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7680976"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ronshapiro">ronshapiro</a> 82 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7680976">link</a></span></div><br>

Our web services are built in Python using the Django framework, and our backend is powered by state-of-the-art machine learning implemented in Java. Your primary responsibilities will focus on frontend development, but you’ll occasionally dive into our Python web services and collaborate on defining our user workflows including UX and visual design. There_#x27;ll be many opportunities to learn a lot about NLP, AI, and machine learning, if you_#x27;re interested.<p>We prefer an on-site employee at our office in Pittsburgh, PA, but can make exceptions for awesome people.

    check us out at www.kiratalent.com_#x2F;about_#x2F;

  - we’re had paying clients since day 1 of the company, and are well funded

  - we’re hiring both mobile and backend developers

  - we believe that even enterprise software can be beautiful, 
    and pride ourselves on our design 

  - every single one of our developers have committed code within their
    first day at work (some within their first hour), and because
    we love continuous deployment, so we_#x27;re constantly pushing to
    production and seeing the impact of our work

Here’s some stuff we’ve been working on lately:<p><pre><code>  - building infrastructure to allow us to scale our video recording 
    and streaming; imagine thousands of applicants from countries 
    all around the world submitting video interviews right before a deadline

  - designing and creating our mobile suite for both job candidates and
    employers alike 

  - presenting analytics data captured in our product to the end user,
    and our team internally
</code></pre>
Our toolkit involves Python (Django), JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS), MySQL (and some MongoDB), Celery, RabbitMQ, Wowza Media Server. We use AWS for hosting, CircleCI for continuous integration and GitHub for everything else (i.e. code reviews, issue tracking).<p>If this sounds fun, let’s chat!

Our product is a management controller that works with OpenStack Swift. Swift gives deployers the ability to create scalable storage pools for modern applications, and SwiftStack provides the management tools for day-to-day operation of the cluster. We charge our customers a recurring license fee for the management software based on how much storage capacity they have deployed.<p>SwiftStack (the company) is about 2.5 years old. We_#x27;ve got about 30 employees, and we_#x27;re actively hiring developers. Here_#x27;s a short list of some things we_#x27;re currently working on:<p><pre><code>    - New features and bugfixes in OpenStack Swift
    - Making clean, responsive UIs to simply communicate information about large storage clusters
    - Using metrics to diagnose errors and proactively fix them for customers

We_#x27;re a financial media company, a poor man_#x27;s - lest we say everyday man_#x27;s - Bloomberg competitor, and a financial product SaaS all forged together into a powerful trident that is attacking the high seas of Wall Street in a relentless pursuit of transparency.<p>And conquer we shall! We_#x27;ve grown 100% quarter over quarter all last year and another 100% just in the last month. Our team has surged to 30+ people and the waves of revenue washed together to form a rushing roar with just one of our products going from nothing to $200k_#x2F;month in under a year.<p>Being a media company we find our way into all kinds of cool stuff. Our office is furnished with things like a $3000 high-end bed that was sent to us to review. We got to talk to and get pictures with Warren Buffett and Lloyd Blankfein (CEO of Goldman Sachs) when they came to Detroit.<p>But, you interject, finance is one of the toughest startup seas to sail upon! The old boys club runs an ironclad ship with no visible decks for boarding. Avast! We_#x27;ve built a battering ram of a business in just a few short years that has pummeled its way deep into the heart of Wall Street. Old Ironsides has warmed itself to Benzinga and once a taste the thirst cannot be quenched.<p>We_#x27;ve recently became Microsoft_#x27;s premier finance partner alongside 3 other companies, all worth over a billion dollars and established for years. As of this Christmas we were installed by default on 500 million desktops and tablets via Windows 8 Finance. No download necessary. That_#x27;s right mateys, we_#x27;re in the source code.<p>And if you happen to trade or invest yourself you_#x27;ll find us inside almost all of the major brokerages in the US.<p>So, where do you fit in this rigging, you swashbuckling scalawag? Well, our team is crazy ambitious, motivated, and experienced with shaking shit up. If you know your tech, and want on deck this is the place to do it. Your exact technical background and language of choice doesn_#x27;t matter as much as your motivation and your ability to adapt quickly.<p>We are a young team and we_#x27;re especially looking for sailors who_#x27;ve got some salt in their whiskers who can help us scale from millions to hundreds of millions.<p>Why be a ninja when you can be a pirate?

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Thanks for the response, and I absolutely take your comments to heart.<p>I feel that salary is something that I_#x27;m transparent about as a hiring manager, and I like to have that conversation early. From my side, I have a very strict budget, without much room to negotiate. When I make an offer, I usually lead with my best offer, and let the candidate know that. Anyone skilled with Google can find the general range for this position so there are no surprises in advance.<p>I do take issue with the predatory part. The Test Engineering role here is really the _#x27;farm team_#x27; for Software Engineering and Systems Engineering, and I feel it_#x27;s a great way to get a sense of how the technology department works from the inside before deciding if you want to move forward here or somewhere else. For some context, every single Test Engineer I_#x27;ve hired for the last ~3 years has gone on to work as an SE. In fact, that_#x27;s why I_#x27;m hiring now. We invest a lot in our TEs, so we_#x27;re not looking to fill these seats with people we can get at the lowest price.<p>All of that said, I appreciate your comments, and will remove that line from future posts. I will, however, continue to talk about salary early and often during the interview process, so that I_#x27;m not wasting anyone_#x27;s time. We can_#x27;t afford 90k for a junior-level position, and I think it_#x27;s only fair to state that up front.<p>Thanks,

We_#x27;ve been around since 2005 as myYearbook, rebranding in 2012 as MeetMe. We_#x27;ve launched other apps such as Choosy, Charm, and Unsaid in the past few months, and are looking to continue adding more standalone apps in the future.<p>We use a wide variety of languages, generally using what makes sense. C, PHP, Python, JavaScript and Node.js, and native iOS and Android development are the most common.<p>MeetMe is a fun place to work. We hold a yearly developer retreat, as well as regular company-wide hackathons. We have a book club, board game club, and we even have a game room. While we aren_#x27;t a new company in the time scale of the internet, we still know how to have fun. We just get the benefit of not having to kill ourselves working 12 hour days. =) This means you_#x27;ll enjoy actually going home on time! We have many openings, both technical and non-technical.  Here is a list of positions we are usually always looking for.<p>* Senior iOS Architect<p>* Senior Android Architect<p>* Software Architect<p>* System Administrator<p>* Director of Software Development<p>* QA Tester for Mobile Applications<p>You can apply directly here: <a href="http://jobvite.com/m?3Je6egw2" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;jobvite.com_#x2F;m?3Je6egw2</a><p>Or you can contact me at jlotito@meetme.com.
