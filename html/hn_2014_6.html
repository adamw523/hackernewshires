We respect each other. We work in small batches. We max out the RAM in our laptops. We drink coffee on Monday mornings and classic cocktails on Friday afternoons. We try to be cutting edge without getting caught up in meaningless buzzwords and flaky vaporware.  We use effective methodologies without being dogmatic or cargo-culty.<p>What are we looking for?<p>That depends. What do you have to bring? We_#x27;re staffing up an entirely new team with a flexible and changing set of technologies, so we_#x27;re not rigid in specific job requirements. We just want talented people who care about making great software in an enjoyable and sustainable way. If that_#x27;s you, please email westlake.robots@gmail.com or contact me directly.

We_#x27;re small (~30 people), which means we can stay close to our clients and develop and improve our products very quickly to meet their needs. It also means you_#x27;ll get great exposure to all of the things that go on in a fast growing business, and have a chance to have a big impact very quickly. We_#x27;re also quite a close-knit team, so we_#x27;re keen to find somebody with good social skills who would enjoy and thrive in this environment.<p>We’re looking for a junior back end web developer to join our growing development team. Development deals with expanding the functionality of Firefly, as well as providing support for the existing areas of the product. Previous experience in real world web development; familiarity with databases, mobile development and other school systems are helpful but not necessary.<p>We_#x27;re looking for someone who is:<p><pre><code>    • A keen and efficient problem solver
    • Independent in their work
    • Able to locate and fix problems in existing code
    • A good team player to work with other members of the team and work alongside
      our support team when necessary
    • Good with time management
    • Happy to take on responsibilities
    • A logical thinker
    • A good communicator – within the team and with other areas of the business

    • Mobile app development (iOS or Android)
    • Linux, PHP and scripting
    • Experience in the education sector
</code></pre>
Most importantly, we_#x27;re looking for someone friendly, enthusiastic and good at picking up new skills quickly.<p>Salary would be competitive and depend on experience. All of the Firefly team also participate in a yearly bonus scheme based on the success of the business and their contribution. We_#x27;re committed to your own professional development, so we offer a flexible training budget for you to spend on attending courses or other events.<p>Apply online at <a href="http://fireflysolutions.co.uk/join-our-team/jobs/junior-developer" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;fireflysolutions.co.uk_#x2F;join-our-team_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;junior-deve...</a> or please drop me an e-mail with any questions at robin+hn1406@fireflysolutions.co.uk.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7852015" href="vote?for=7852015_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%38%32%39%30%34%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7852015"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=notarockstar">notarockstar</a> 47 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7852015">link</a></span></div><br>

Since releasing the Clever APIs in 2012, we_#x27;ve signed up the most innovative education companies as partners and deployed our platform to 1 in every 7 schools in America. Clever is making it easier for 4M students to use technology in the classroom, and that number is growing rapidly.<p>We have all the usual SF startup perks: a beautiful loft office in SoMa, free lunch, and great benefits. More importantly, you’ll be working around a team of 24 smart, talented people (9 engineers) who are all equally committed to solving this particular problem.<p>We’re always pushing each other to learn new things, both technical and nontechnical - in the past few weeks we’ve done collaborative tech talks on things like:<p>-exoplanets<p>-kitesurfing<p>-Magic: the Gathering<p>-Regular Expressions for Regular People<p>(We also play a lot of bughouse chess.)<p>We’re looking for full-stack engineers who can hack in Node, Go, and Python (or are willing to learn), but more importantly, we’re looking for people who share our passion for improving education.

The office is located in SOMA in San Francisco.<p>=============<p>Frontend Engineer at Prismatic: iOS, Web, and Android. <a href="http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5971" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io_#x2F;prismatic_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;5971</a><p>==<p>Strong CS basics in data structures and algorithms. Strong engineering; thoughtful design and clean code. Graphics, browser, games, or animation experience a big plus.
A front-end engineer that has a strong computer science background, but wants to focus on product engineering rather than backend systems. You don’t want to just take off the shelf UI components, but want to explore new interactions. You aren’t afraid to dig under the hood of iOS frameworks or browser code in order to make an animation or interaction feel natural and smooth.<p>=============<p>Backend Engineer at Prismatic: <a href="http://boards.greenhouse.io/prismatic/jobs/5976" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;boards.greenhouse.io_#x2F;prismatic_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;5976</a><p>==<p>Prismatic is a great place to be a backend engineer - we analyze millions of shared web pages every day, automatically classify them into tens of thousands of topics, and serve up personalized feeds in real-time using our homegrown, lightning fast, machine learning-based relevance engine. We are looking to grow our top-notch team, with both junior and senior-level positions available.
We are looking for engineers with deep interest and knowledge in at least one area core to our business (i.e., distributed systems, ops and tooling, machine learning, designing and building new product features). We’re a small team, so you will have the opportunity to have a lot of impact, and to learn from peers who are extremely talented engineers, computer scientists, and data experts. Our backend is written entirely in Clojure, a JVM-based LISP that is a dream to work in. Almost none of us knew it before we joined, and we don’t expect you to either. We do, however, expect the following:
- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess. - You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs. - You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful. - You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two. - You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are. - You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.
Here’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:
- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive - Building out new product features in our API - Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly - Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more - Creating tools to assist development and ops - Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7829982" href="vote?for=7829982_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%38%32%39%30%34%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7829982"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zain">zain</a> 51 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7829982">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">San Francisco, CA OR Pittsburgh, PA OR Telecommute - Full Time<p>Stitch Fix is the first ecommerce brand to blend proprietary technology, unique product and human-powered design to deliver a shopping experience that is truly personalized for our clients.<p>Founded in 2011, we_#x27;ve grown from word-of-mouth and our leadership team includes former execs and engineers from Netflix, Polyvore, OPower, Baseline Ventures, and Uniqlo, among other leaders in the data and retailing fields.<p>We_#x27;re building a Full Stack Startup to solve major challenges in ecommerce, apparel, merchandising, client experience, personal styling, inventory management and logistics, and we_#x27;re set to double our engineering team of 9 in the next year.<p>If you want to come build new products and solve interesting problems with a great group of people, we_#x27;re looking for more excited and talented individuals to join us.<p>More about our engineering team: 
We_#x27;re working in a post-Agile process and are developing a distributed architecture of Rails applications (no monorails here) that not only help our clients, but also improve everything we do at Stitch Fix.<p>Our engineering and data science team is small, senior, and autonomous with no QA, product managers or project managers. We work with direct access to our clients and business data, and we communicate openly and transparently with the executive team.<p>We_#x27;re working from San Francisco, Pittsburgh and remotely and we rely on collaborative communication and dev tools like GitHub, HipChat, Google Hangouts and Heroku to get it all done.<p>The Role: 
We_#x27;re looking for a Sr. Full Stack Engineer to join our team. We_#x27;re building a new kind of enterprise, service-oriented set of applications that_#x27;s powering one of the most innovative ecommerce platforms ever.<p>Here are some things we_#x27;re working on: 
* Advanced learning algorithms to aid our awesome styling team 
* Multiple-application architecture running in the cloud 
* Custom warehouse and inventory systems for a very unique business model 
* Responsive web interfaces to drive both the customer experience and our internal tools 
* Building prediction models for a smart and successful future<p>We build through open communication, collaboration, prototyping and testing. We work mostly in Rails with some Python. We love HipChat and Google Hangouts. We use new continuous integration tools like Tddium to deploy to Heroku.<p>Our Ideal Candidate: 
Is someone who_#x27;s developed a couple solid Rails and other MVC-framework web applications as part of a collaborative team.<p>We_#x27;re especially looking for lead engineers who can demonstrate aptitude in the following skills: 
* Real tech fluency: You can build anything with anything, and you probably have 5+ years of software development experience with a couple of those years working in Ruby on Rails. 
* Communication skills: You aren_#x27;t just great at listening, speaking and writing. You are able to convey complex ideas and information regardless of the medium or situation. 
* Product-Centric Thinking: You come from a tech background but you have opinions about how the product you_#x27;re building should work. You dig deep and work with customers, the company and our executive team to uncover the ideal way to leverage technology to solve problems. 
* Self-Directed: Once you_#x27;ve got something, we don_#x27;t have to worry about it. You have a bias toward action. Our team doesn_#x27;t have QA, project managers or product managers so we take ownership of what we build. 
* Passion: You love what you do and can share side projects or open source contributions with a GitHub repository, personal project page or blog. 
* Just Generally Awesome: You take your work seriously but not yourself. You show everyone respect regardless of the circumstance. Extra points if we think you_#x27;re funny or if you_#x27;re already a Stitch Fix superfan!<p>Bonus Points For: 
* Experience working collaboratively as a team. We use GitHub, Heroku and HipChat to get stuff done. We_#x27;re agnostic about what you_#x27;ve used (and no judging if you_#x27;re more into BitBucket) and are more interested in the process you like to use. 
* Experience working with testing and continuous integration. We_#x27;re working with the usual Ruby gems like Rspec, Capybara and others for unit and feature tests, Tddium for CI and RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging. 
* Experience using pull requests to create rapid prototypes and new features. If we like what you make (and if you like what we_#x27;re making), we agree to merge it to production! 
* Unique ways to automate and get things done. For example, if you_#x27;ve created a Ruby gem to complete a task in your projects, tell us about it! :)<p>We knew you_#x27;d ask eventually, so here_#x27;s what we_#x27;re offering: 
* Competitive salaries and generous equity. 
* A business that trusts and embraces tech. We know, a style brand? But it_#x27;s totally true. 
* Want to move to San Francisco or Pittsburgh? Stitch Fix has your relocation expenses covered. 
* A senior team that does things right. 
* A startup with a proven business model that_#x27;s growing fast. 
* Use your preference of tools and hardware. 
* A comprehensive health insurance plan, including full dental and vision coverage. 
* Fully stocked pantry with your choice of snacks and drinks. 
* Sunny office in downtown San Francisco and also in downtown Pittsburgh (or you can come visit our SF office once every 2 months if you prefer to work remotely)<p>How To Apply

As a core contributor, you will work with the existing contributor team to add new features to the framework, fix issues, interact with the community, and build out build and test services. We are looking for strong Javascript developers that love the web but are interested in adapting native concepts to the browser. We are lucky to say we get to work on open source as a full time job!<p>We are also looking for two backend developers to help build out our as yet unreleased backend services and tools which will give Ionic developers some unique and powerful features that make building on Ionic very compelling. Come help us build out our service stack on AWS with Docker, Python, and Go.<p>In the few months since Ionic has been out, the project has seen some really great adoption. With 6200 stars, Ionic is one of the top 120 projects on github and rising quickly. Traffic is growing 40% month over month, and our developer community is becoming very strong. Come join our team of 12 (a mixture of Madison and remote in the US) in making native development a thing of the past!

The number of patient referrals has doubled in the last 10 years to 107 million per year- most of them via fax.

Informa Investment Solutions, Inc. is seeking both a senior and a junior web developer to join our web applications team at our office on the shores of Lake Tahoe. If you love designing and building modern, responsive web applications that make it easy for business users to run sophisticated investment analysis software, we would like to talk to you. We’re an established company with actual paying customers and we want to make our little corner of the world a better place for our users.<p>We use standards-based HTML, JavaScript and CSS to build a cross-browser UI. We use a lot of state of the art technology – HTML5, canvas, RequireJS, Backbone, LESS and node.js. The backend is a mixture of C#, Java, C++ because we believe in using the right tool for the job, and we are regularly evaluating our tools to ensure that. Our development process is agile and we release our web products approximately once a month.<p>Our offices are a five minute walk from the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe and Heavenly ski resort is a fifteen minute drive from the office. As a developer you’ll also get your own private office and even though we mostly develop on Windows, all our developers have Mac hardware.
We prefer to hire generalists who are as curious and excited about technology as we are. All of us enjoy learning new technologies and tools; we have a small team and each developer should be able to work on every aspect of the system.<p>Please note: this is a full-time, on-site position. We would prefer you to work in our Zephyr Cove office, but we also have offices in White Plains, NY or Nashville, TN that you could work out of. If you_#x27;re interested, please email matt.motherway -at- informais.com (and put “Hacker News” in the subject).

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">OpenSignal - London, UK (Full time, permanent)<p>At OpenSignal we are using mobile apps to tap into the smart phones we are all carrying around with us to build up global crowdsourced sensor networks.  Our first[1] is for wireless signal where we are building a global database on the coverage and performance of wireless networks (both mobile + WiFi) on a scale that has never before been possible.  Our second sensor network is WeatherSignal[2], which uses the barometers, thermometers and hygrometers on smart phones to crowdsource weather data and we have already published a scientific paper[3] showing the potential of this approach.<p>If the concept of crowdsourced sensor networks appeals to you too then please get in touch.  We are hiring for all manner of different roles right not (backend, frontend, UX_#x2F;UI _amp; data science) but most of all we are just looking for smart, like minded people rather than people with specific, existing skills.<p>More info: <a href="http://opensignal.com/jobs/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;opensignal.com_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;</a><p>[1]<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.staircase3.opensignal" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;play.google.com_#x2F;store_#x2F;apps_#x2F;details?id=com.staircase3...</a>

<a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/jobs/" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.rainforestqa.com_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;</a><p>FULL STACK ENGINEER<p>Are you an experienced web-software hacker? If you have worked on a production web site with meaningful traffic and customers, know at least 3 programming languages and are comfortable writing unit tests then we want to talk to you.<p>Are you opinionated and diplomatic? Most people are one or the other. All major decisions are made democratically, and we do code reviews on every pull request to keep quality high. You need to be able to express your opinions in as objective a manner as possible, and be able to accept and learn from constructive criticism. There_#x27;s always a better way to do something.<p>Are you working on personal projects _#x2F; your own startup? You_#x27;ll need to be a self-starter to get on at Rainforest, because we_#x27;ll give you a lot of freedom and almost no hand-holding.<p>DESIGNERS WHO CODE<p>Design is at the heart of everything we do. We fundamentally believe that great design - meaning usability, simplicity and elegance - is core to our competitive advantage, and one of the most important ways we can work toward our mission of making developers happier and more productive.<p>We are proponents of noPSD design (so much so that we wrote a blog post about our process). To that end you should at the very least be comfortable with mocking up your designs in HTML and CSS, and ideally be able to own the entire front-end process of shipping a new feature, from conception through user research, to design and build, and iterating based on usage metrics and qualitative feedback.<p>We know we_#x27;re looking for a unicorn, so if you feel like you_#x27;re an excellent front-end hacker whose design chops are a bit rusty you should still get in touch. Design is all about iteration, and we already have a great designer on our team who can help you grow as a designer.<p>DEV OPS<p>We_#x27;re looking for an exceptional DevOps engineer to join as the next member of Rainforest. We_#x27;re still a very small team, but people usually think we_#x27;re much bigger given the scale at which we operate.<p>One of the more technically complex parts of our infrastructure is managing a large stack of virtual machines. Every single test run through Rainforest is done through a newly minted VM. This means that we boot thousands of machines every single day. Given our current growth, we expect this to grow exponentially.<p>Here_#x27;s what we hope to get out of you: You_#x27;re not afraid of writing code, our stack is Ruby, so you_#x27;ll have to either know it or be ready to learn it. You need to have prior experience with a provisioning tool (Puppet, Chef, etc). You understand systems and networks thoroughly. You know things we don_#x27;t about distributed systems.<p>We_#x27;re working on super hard problems that make developers_#x27; lives easier. We are a group of friends that love what we_#x27;re working on, and believe that we_#x27;re going to change the world for people building software.<p>DATA NERD<p>We run a lot of tests here at Rainforest. We record everything that testers do to execute each test. Clicks, text entry, submission times, answers, screenshots… everything. Alongside that, we have fine-grained metrics on our testers, where they are from, what time they log into the system, how often they test with Rainforest. That_#x27;s a lot of data and we could do so much more with it.<p>We_#x27;re looking for someone to help us do that. Your role will be to use this data to improve the quality of the results we return to our customers, detect fraud, resolve disputes, generate tests automatically and many many other things.<p>We_#x27;re looking for someone with a strong background in data science, statistics and supervised learning. You_#x27;ll also need to be able to write code to productize your work. Most importantly, you should be able to own your projects and see them through to improving the lives of our customers. This role would probably be perfect for academics who want to get into a small team that moves fast and ships software every day.<p>Apply via our website! <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/jobs/" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.rainforestqa.com_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7829172" href="vote?for=7829172_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%38%32%39%30%34%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7829172"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=lamby">lamby</a> 51 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7829172">link</a></span></div><br>

TrueVault stores healthcare data from mobile health apps, wearable devices and even genomic research so that our customers don’t need to spend their precious time worrying about security, performance and scalability. More than just a database as a service, TrueVault’s proprietary technology allows us to secure our customers_#x27; data better than anyone else can (hint: think encryption and global scale slice distribution).<p>Our mission is to provide the simplest, most secure way for web apps, mobile apps and even wearable devices to store sensitive data. Simple and secure access and storage to people’s most personal and private information is a huge challenge. That_#x27;s why we are looking for incredible people (like you perhaps?) to join us.<p>Who is TrueVault?<p>TrueVault is a Y Combinator graduated startup based in SoMa San Francisco. We have an incredible group of investors including Paul Buchheit, Mark Pincus, and Bill Tai who have invested more than $3 million dollars because they deeply believe in our mission. We are a group of engineers passionate about data security, API performance and building products that developers like us love to use. We are looking for a handful of engineering MacGyvers to join our founding team.<p>Why Join TrueVault?<p>Because at TrueVault, you will have the opportunity to work in arguably the biggest market opportunity of this coming decade, improve the collection, portability and security of really critical data, and push the envelop of data portability forward. You’ll work on things that haven_#x27;t been done before. Plus you’ll get to choose what you want to work on and develop products that your peers will rely on and love using.<p>If you want to work at a place that values _quot;getting things done_quot; more than _quot;working the startup hours_quot; talk to us. If you take pride in what you do and care about the people who use the product you’ll find people just like you here. If you want to open source and share what you’ve built with the world at TrueVault you can.  But most importantly, if you want to work with other incredible minds and welcome the challenges of doing things that’ve never been done, then we want you to join us. If you are passionate about security, performance and scalability, TrueVault might be just what you’re looking for.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7830127" href="vote?for=7830127_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%38%32%39%30%34%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7830127"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=aston">aston</a> 51 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7830127">link</a></span></div><br>

Engineering is the department that drives our apps, tools, data, and interfaces forward. This attitude comes not only from the Engineers, but from our CEO and other top management. They believe in us.<p>We have awesome problems to solve.<p>The housing market provides a fantastic blend of problems.  We need creative people to help us combine the data about every address in America with the soft side of helping people find a home that makes them feel safe, happy, and comfortable.<p>Stability is wonderful.<p>We_#x27;re that rare company that holds the culture of its startup roots, while blending in the sanity of a regular work schedule with an emphasis on work_#x2F;life_#x2F;family balance.<p>You:<p>- You have experience working on high-traffic, scalable internet applications
- You love solving hard problems and working in small teams with smart people
- You_#x27;re comfortable with everything from bash scripting to javascript
- You_#x27;re a great person
- You love making fast websites<p>What you_#x27;ll work with:<p>Our base web stack is LAMP, but that rides on top of Solr_#x2F;Lucene, Hadoop, Memcache, Python, Couchbase, Open Street Maps, and more.  We’re rewriting our website to use Javascript on both client and server using Rendr.js, Node.js and Backbone.js.  We use jQuery on the client, d3.js and Raphel.js for our charts and Git for source control. We_#x27;re learning OOCSS and are folding SASS into our workflow as well. If there_#x27;s something that_#x27;s a good idea for the team, we_#x27;ll do our best to implement it.<p>How we work:<p>The engineering team is about a hundred people, and we break into small teams of 2-4 to focus on specific projects.  The rentals team is a small, vertically-integrated team within the larger engineering team.  We are responsible for the entire Trulia Rentals product, giving us the speed and flexibility of a startup with the resources of a public company.<p>We release weekly, but new features are always under development and often span releases. Our local QA team writes automation tests and does hand testing of your features, working with you to ensure that only high quality code gets to production. Organizationally, we_#x27;re pretty flat, though you_#x27;ll have a mentor with whom you_#x27;ll have weekly 1-on-1 meetings, to review code, exchange ideas, and ensure we_#x27;re doing everything we can for you to thrive in your role.<p>Behind the curtain:
- _#x27;Innovation Week_#x27; every quarter
- People you_#x27;re happy to see every day
- Stocked Kitchens and two kegerators
- Unbeatable SOMA location with penthouse roof deck

Our marketplace, delivered through the web and mobile applications, gives consumers powerful tools to research homes and neighborhoods and enables real estate professionals to efficiently market their listings and attract new clients.<p>Trulia was founded in 2005, backed by Accel Partners and Sequoia Capital, and had a successful IPO in 2012.

Existing formats are drawn out; we can be informationally dense and fast-paced. We_#x27;ll include a few relevant figures; we_#x27;ll also add footnotes, equations, and primary literarure citations for those that want to pause and do their own further exploration.<p>A perfect description of our demographic is HN--educated adults who might not actually be pursuing the field we_#x27;re covering but have a ton of interest in science. This market also includes advanced college and high school students that likewise share the same level of interest.<p>The lectures can be broad surveys or deep coverage of a particular area of research or discovery.
We_#x27;re going to fund filming about 3 videos, film them here in Atlanta, and then test the market for fit (ie. _quot;Show HN_quot;). If the market demands a less _quot;smart_quot; or info-dense video, we_#x27;ll probably abandon the project.

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">MindTribe - San Francisco, CA<p>We make hardware. We’re looking for senior firmware engineers to join the team!<p>The hard requirements are brief: 5+ years of writing code for embedded systems with experience leading projects. At Mindtribe we code most often in C. In addition to technical work, our senior engineers plan projects, lead teams of engineers, and mentor junior members.<p>At this point, you can tackle most technical challenges that come your way. The rest you could figure out given enough time. You’re starting to grow into someone who can elevate an entire team – not just by adding engineering horsepower, but by multiplying the abilities of those around you. You could probably get a job anywhere you want. Why Mindtribe?<p>As a product development consultancy, we get to peek inside a lot of exciting companies. That’s how we know there’s nowhere else we’d rather be.<p>Nobody sees the kind of variety that we do. Working at Mindtribe is being immersed in a constant stream of projects across different industries using different technologies. You will learn. A lot. About everything. Mindtribers are not just versatile within their own fields – “firmware” engineers work with everything from 8-bit micros to embedded Linux to smartphones – we also have EE’s driving SolidWorks, ME’s developing iOS apps, and FW engineers laying out PCB’s. You’ll iterate through many careers-worth of projects and solutions faster than you thought possible. And you’ll get better at it each time.<p>Everyone here loves hardware, so much that we’ve been known to spend leisure time on projects that aren’t so different from what we do at work. Or perhaps it’s the other way around. We may code in bits and bytes, but we work in the real world. Our desks are cluttered with dev boards and prototypes. We work shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates, discuss our work throughout each day, and build amazing things together. We’re constantly in front of clients to extract feedback, plot course corrections, and lead the way.<p>Mindtribe succeeds by putting forward strong teams with sound methods. While we consider ourselves talented engineers, relying on heroic individual efforts to meet impossible deadlines is a painful way to squeak by. Instead, our edge comes from constant introspection about how we do engineering, and we are always looking for ways to improve. Things that are broken here don’t stay that way for long.<p>We’re a small company. As a result, your contributions will have immediate, visible impacts not just on projects, but also on the success of the entire organization. Although we all swab the decks, everyone also gets to help steer.<p>Mindtribe is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, convenient to public transit and at the epicenter of a flourishing technology industry. We enjoy working together and place great value in maintaining an awesome company environment. ‘Tribers regularly spend time together outside the office, whether that’s doing happy hour at a local watering hole or enjoying the rocking chairs at the new Exploratorium.<p>For more information about us, check out our team (<a href="http://www.mindtribe.com/team" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.mindtribe.com_#x2F;team</a>), our portfolio (<a href="http://www.mindtribe.com/portfolio" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.mindtribe.com_#x2F;portfolio</a>), and our method (<a href="http://www.mindtribe.com/method" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.mindtribe.com_#x2F;method</a>).<p>If this is resonating, we’d love to get to know you! Please drop us a line at nopnjmp@mindtribe.com to tell us how you’ve demonstrated leadership in your career and why you’d be excited to do what we do.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7830110" href="vote?for=7830110_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%38%32%39%30%34%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7830110"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=blucz">blucz</a> 51 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7830110">link</a></span></div><br>

This is an opportunity to join us in developing an application that reaches over 20 million users annually.<p>In this role, you will eventually be responsible for the end-to-end development of a Windows Store Application built using the C#_#x2F;Xaml_#x2F;WinRT stack. You will be working closely with UI_#x2F;UX and graphic designers to bring a highly bespoke user experience to life.<p>At Meridian, we have a strong developer-driven project management culture and a track record of on-time delivery without trashing our weekends. We constantly iterate on the development process to keep things running smoothly.<p>While you will be working out of our New York office, our culture is extremely casual, and our office hours and work-from-home policies are flexible.<p>Skills _amp; Requirements<p>Requirements:
- Experience with Windows 8_#x2F;8.1 App development using C#_#x2F;Xaml and Visual Studio
- Strong fluency in C#, Xaml, and WPF
- Experience communicating with services built using JSON, HTTP, REST, OAuth, etc
- Experience working closely with graphic designers to build applications<p>Preferred Skills:
- Experience with Android or iOS development
- UI Design experience
- Photoshop familiarity<p>About Meridian Audio<p>In 2000, unsatisfied with the music products that existed in the world, a few rabid music fans got together to create something better. We built Sooloos because we wanted its features for ourselves: the ability to browse huge music libraries and stream audio to multiple rooms. We built touchscreen kiosks and put them in our friends_#x27; houses and in our favorite bars. We kept our day jobs, but in our own time we relentlessly pursued the world_#x27;s coolest music listening experience.<p>After a few years, we were surprised that other products in the space were still unable to meet our needs, so we turned our hobby into a company and shipped our first product in 2006. We built our own hardware using studio-grade audio components and packaged Sooloos as a high-end music server for the audiophile market, which received us with open arms.<p>In late 2008 we were acquired by Meridian Audio, which had a culture of innovation in audio hardware and DSP that matched our own in UX and streaming. In addition to manufacturing the gold standard of high-performance multi-zone music solutions, we also develop software music products for Jaguar Land Rover, Hewlett Packard, and a variety of audio OEMs.<p>Five years post acquisition, everyone on our original development team is still with us. Our reference product serves a community of 10,000 specialty users, and we have 10 million activations and 1.5 million monthly actives for HP Connected Music, the product we bundle on nearly 20 million PCs annually. We work with the biggest services in the business including Last.fm, AllMusic Guide, Rhapsody, Deezer, TuneIn, iHeart Radio, Spotify, 7digital, Songkick, Musicbrainz, LyricFind, and Qobuz.<p>Our team is headquartered in Meridian_#x27;s New York office in Soho (home to the most amazing digital theater ever) but we routinely work remotely, sometimes on four continents at once. Our flat structure relies on the initiative and accountability of everyone on the team; we all own projects (and in some cases product) and our output speaks for itself.<p>Please contact hiring@sooloos.com if you_#x27;re interested</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7834572" href="vote?for=7834572_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%38%32%39%30%34%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7834572"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=krg">krg</a> 50 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7834572">link</a></span></div><br>

We specialize in web application development but look for well-rounded application developers. If you are a solid programmer and a team player, this is an opportunity for you. Even if you don_#x27;t have experience with everything listed in this ad, we offer excellent learning opportunities for those who are eager to expand their skill sets. Job Responsibilities<p>Working in small development teams, programmers participate in the architecture, design, and implementation of primarily Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, and PHP code to meet client requirements for robust, high-performance, and secure sites and applications. Developers get exposure to several client projects and a variety of technologies over time. Job Qualifications<p>In addition to overall programming capability, candidates must have experience working on collaborative development teams and very strong communication skills. While we employ and enjoy the company of extroverts and introverts alike, we reiterate that the ability to communicate clearly is a must-have for our technical staff. That means writing professional e-mails and interpreting the nuances of clients_#x27; requirements by asking good questions, for example.<p>We work hard to estimate projects accurately so that schedules are reasonable and developers work a normal amount of hours per week. We rely on developers to contribute to those estimates and provide feedback as a project goes along to keep things on track.<p>Ideal candidates will have experience building all facets of software systems including the data model, business logic, and front-end. 3+ years of object-oriented design and development in Java, JavaScript, Python, or Ruby is desired. On the front-end, HTML 5 and CSS experience is required.<p>Knowledge of some or all of the following specific tools and technologies is a plus:<p><pre><code>    Languages: Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, Ruby, PHP
    Tools: Continuous Integration (Jenkins, Hudson, etc.), static code analysis (Sonar, etc.), Eclipse, IntelliJ, Ant, Maven
    Web: vert.x, Play, Spring, Django, Rails, node.js, JSP, Servlets, jQuery, etc.
    Mobile: iOS, Android, PhoneGap, jQuery Mobile or similar
    Hosting: AWS (EC2, RDS, etc.), cloud servers, Linux configuration, application servers (Resin, etc.)
    Data Persistence: ORM (Hibernate, etc.), MySQL, Postgres, MS SQL Server, Oracle, NoSQL (CouchDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc.) 
</code></pre>
We like technical people who are not afraid to have strong opinions about technology but simultaneously keep an open mind and are flexible enough to work with whatever technology the task at hand requires.<p>That said, we_#x27;re mostly looking for great developers who are great to work with. If you don_#x27;t have experience with everything listed above (and who does?) but are still a solid developer eager to learn new things, you might be a great fit here.<p>Please apply here: <a href="http://jobs.techempower.com/hn" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;jobs.techempower.com_#x2F;hn</a></font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7845747" href="vote?for=7845747_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%37%38%32%39%30%34%32"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7845747"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=scottdthomas">scottdthomas</a> 48 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7845747">link</a></span></div><br>

You_#x27;d be coming to work at 350 Bloor St. E for a division that acts like a startup-within-a-company, with people who aren_#x27;t afraid to experiment and are trying to forment a data-driven culture.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7831326" href="vote?for=7831326_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%34%79%39%4d%35%74%6d%6b%54%5a%61%6d%70%34%66%6d%79%4b%52%30%44%4f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7831326"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bazillion">bazillion</a> 51 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7831326">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Expensify-San Francisco, CA-Fulltime, Programmer Extraordinaire<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do _quot;expense reports that don_#x27;t suck!_quot; (Google _quot;expensify_quot; to read more.) We_#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren_#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it_#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won_#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn_#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We_#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We_#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing_#x2F;designing_#x2F;building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you_#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you_#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you_#x27;re this sort of person, you_#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn_#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That_#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it_#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I_#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don_#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href="http://we.are.expensify.com/apply" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;we.are.expensify.com_#x2F;apply</a>).

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Where are we?<p>- Doesn’t matter - you can work from your preferred location. But in case you’re wondering, we’re in Hattiesburg, MS.<p>Who are we?<p>- <a href="http://www.schoolstatus.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.schoolstatus.com</a><p>- SchoolStatus is a data framework for the K-12 education industry that combines a school district_#x27;s disjointed data systems into one easily-accessed location. Our web-based interface allows educators to make data-driven decisions - regardless of previous technology experience. We also provide a mechanism for principals to deliver evaluation measures to teachers for real-time classroom feedback.<p>- Our backend engine provides mechanisms for automated data retrieval and sanitation, allowing the customer’s data to remain fresh with no interaction needed.<p>- Launched in January 2013, we’ve quickly become the data solution for roughly 50% of Mississippi public school districts and are currently migrating into other states.  We’ve been revenue-driven and maintain profitability, which has made us attractive to potential funding sources and we’re currently considering our options.<p>Who are you?<p>- You are a talented, enthusiastic programmer that can’t wait to assist in the development of our backend engine and front-end interfaces.  Our core technologies include:<p>* Ruby as primary language on backend.  Due to lack of APIs on many third-party educational systems, data retrieval is often performed by various scraping methods.  Experience with Mechanize, Nokogiri, Watir, and the likes are the icing on your cake.<p>* Ruby’s Padrino, a highly extensible framework built on Sinatra, is the glue connecting our backend to frontend.<p>* MongoDB, Redis, Postgresql, Elasticsearch, and Amazon Redshift provide our various data stores.<p>* Objective-C_#x2F;UIKit powers our teacher evaluation instrument for iPad and you are totally okay with that.<p>* Angular.js on the frontend is something that makes you smile. Data visualizations created with Highcharts, D3, and Charts.js.<p>* By no means are we limited to the languages and technologies above.  Solutions from other areas are always welcome - as long as they play nice with others (Flash.)<p>What will we give you?<p>- Competitive salary with full health, vision, and dental benefits.<p>- Retirement plan (comparable to the big guys that have way more meetings) with company match that will make sure your cohabitating hamsters are well-cared for in their old age.<p>- Flexible vacation structure (meaning just tell us you’re going out of town), including a company-provided condominium in Florida.  Yes, we have a condo.<p>What will you give us?<p>- Loyalty to the company goals as a whole and a desire to serve the greater good.<p>- Flexibility to perform outside of your specific role when it’s needed, included talking with customers and attending trade shows from time to time.<p>- A good sense of humor - because nobody likes a boring job.<p>----<p>Contact us with questions, resume_#x2F;CV, or portfolio at hack@schoolstatus.com</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7851362" href="vote?for=7851362_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%34%79%39%4d%35%74%6d%6b%54%5a%61%6d%70%34%66%6d%79%4b%52%30%44%4f"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7851362"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=evaneykelen">evaneykelen</a> 47 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7851362">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Scribd (YC _#x27;06), San Francisco - H1B, FULL-TIME, and INTERN are all welcome
Scribd (_quot;Netflix for eBooks_quot;, top 100 website, 50 people) is hiring talented hackers of all kinds to help us build the library of the 21st century.
We_#x27;ve hired SEVEN full-time people and TONS of interns from these _quot;Who is Hiring_quot; threads ... it really works! We_#x27;re looking for people who want to work with:<p><pre><code>  *   Ruby on Rails (we_#x27;re the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)
  *   Javascript (well, we use Coffeescript)
  *   iOS OR Android (we_#x27;re a top 10 eBook app, with a tiny mobile team)
  *   Machine Learning _#x2F; data mining _#x2F; recommendations - think Netflix prize, but for books!
  *   Internships: junior standing or above for all areas of engineering. 

</code></pre>
That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you_#x27;ve used so far, so if you haven_#x27;t used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We_#x27;ve hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.<p>We_#x27;re profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (go-karts + a rock climbing wall!).
Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup.

Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, at the moment we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as evolutionary design, pair programming, and continuous deployment. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share what we learnt. Our developers are generalizing specialists; a typical day may include refining an algorithm, writing a tricky integration test, fixing a responsive-design problem on iPhones, tuning an SQL query, and discussing feature nuances with a product manager. Our team is growing fast and we_#x27;d like to hear (at careers@secretsales.com) from any of you who_#x27;d like to join us; we_#x27;re hiring for all technical roles, especially developers of all levels of experience.<p>Established in London in July 2007, Secretsales.com is the UK_#x27;s leading private shopping club, offering limited-time online sales with current name-brand goods at deep discounts.

Modernizing laundry has real environmental benefits to water usage, not to mention the convenience factor of a delivery service.  As humanity becomes more and more urban and less and less likely to have space for a personal washer and dryer, demand for efficient laundry service is growing.<p>Rinse needs to tackle interesting technical challenges as well.  Of course, the routing problem as popularized by the Traveling Salesman Problem (except with multiple, load-balanced agents) is a challenge, but since we are also taking photos of the clothes we process, there are interesting data mining, machine learning, and image processing applications as well.  This is in addition to the joys of rapidly scaling an operational system, while continually optimizing a consumer-facing product.<p>We_#x27;re looking for skilled developers of all types to join us.

Typically public keys that old without a contemporary e-mail address are no longer in use and the corresponding private key has often been lost.<p>It would be nice if you could make a new key available (RSA with 3072 or 4096 bit) for either the iwanttohack address or your own address, and preferrably link to it on your hiring page. It would underscore your privacy credo and help you stand out from the crowd.

We_#x27;ve been around since 2005 as myYearbook, rebranding in 2012 as MeetMe. We_#x27;ve launched other apps such as Choosy, Charm, and Unsaid in the past few months, and are looking to continue adding more standalone apps in the future.<p>We use a wide variety of languages, generally using what makes sense. C, PHP, Python, JavaScript and Node.js, and native iOS and Android development are the most common.<p>MeetMe is a fun place to work. We hold a yearly developer retreat, as well as regular company-wide hackathons. We have a book club, board game club, and we even have a game room. While we aren_#x27;t a new company in the time scale of the internet, we still know how to have fun. We just get the benefit of not having to kill ourselves working 12 hour days. =) This means you_#x27;ll enjoy actually going home on time! We have many openings, both technical and non-technical. Here is a list of positions we are usually always looking for.<p>* Senior Web Developer<p>* Senior Android Engineer_#x2F;Architect<p>* Software iOS Architect<p>* Network Engineer<p>You can apply directly here: <a href="http://jobvite.com/m?3Je6egw2" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;jobvite.com_#x2F;m?3Je6egw2</a><p>Or you can contact me at jlotito@meetme.com.

   ====== What we do =========
   ===========================
</code></pre>
Real-time logistics optimization (EZPass for Ports).<p>On the left side of the problem, we track every ship on the water so that we can make predictions about the impact of a bunch of things on the rest of the supply chain (this mostly manifests itself in us being able to help companies save a bunch of money on demurrage. One company we_#x27;re working with, alone, spends 6.5 mil every month on this). On the right side of the problem, we let truckers know when they need to arrive at a port in order to wait in line the least amount of time (so that they spend more time making money and less time waiting). Right smack dab in the middle, we optimize port throughput by scheduling all the right people to do the right thing at the right time.<p><pre><code>   ===========================
   ===== How we do it ========
   ===========================
</code></pre>
Web_#x2F;data stack -_gt; Clojure + postgres_#x2F;cassandra_#x2F;redis_#x2F;rabbit + ruby on rails (along with hadoop_#x2F;EMR)<p>Mobile -_gt; Currently building iOS app, android in the near term<p>Algorithms -_gt; a dizzying mixture of oldschool and newschool techniques ;-)<p><pre><code>   ===========================
   ====== And the rest =======
   ===========================
</code></pre>
We_#x27;ve got some very interesting partners and customers (ranging from telcos to enterprise software providers to regional and international logistics companies). We also have some top tier investors (a16z)!<p>Looking for help on mobile, frontend, and data science sides! Would be thrilled to find a CTO to grow the tech side of the company with me, but I_#x27;m also happy to find engineers who know their shit who just want to build great things.<p>If this sounds interesting, please shoot me an email at marc@weft.io!</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7829118" href="vote?for=7829118_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%55%51%75%79%32%4a%42%79%43%70%65%32%67%43%70%78%4e%42%66%4f%59%63"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7829118"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mattt416">mattt416</a> 51 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7829118">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I just noticed that new this month there is a line noting not to post recruiting firms. Does my post breach this rule?<p>I_#x27;ve been posting to HN Who_#x27;s Hiring for months now and have met some great people through it, some of which I_#x27;ve placed with my clients.<p>I post here as a partner to the firms I represent, so I hope it is not looked at as SPAM. I work closely with NYC_#x27;s digital _amp; startup communities, representing a number of businesses that are looking to hire talent.<p>While I certainly appreciate that best practices from agency recruiters in this space are typically subpar, I offer a valuable asset to the companies I work with. Many do not have the resources to identify the number of engineers they need to push their business forward. This is where I come in and can help augment their efforts.</font></span><p><font size="1"><font color="#f6f6ef">-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border="0"><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td valign="top"><center><a id="up_7835825" href="vote?for=7835825_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%55%51%75%79%32%4a%42%79%43%70%65%32%67%43%70%78%4e%42%66%4f%59%63"><div class="votearrow" title="upvote"></div></a><span id="down_7835825"></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=twentyjp">twentyjp</a> 50 days ago  | <a href="item?id=7835825">link</a></span></div><br>
