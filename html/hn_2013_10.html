<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Buffer (<a href="http://bufferapp.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;bufferapp.com</a>) - REMOTE (We_#x27;re a small distributed team of 13 people across the US, UK, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Sweden and Australia)<p>I_#x27;d love for you to come join Buffer for the fun ride. We just crossed 1 million users and are on a $2m annual revenue run rate. There are some super interesting challenges ahead to scale Buffer as we start to focus on Buffer for business.<p>We_#x27;re looking to expand our engineering team with the following open positions.<p>* DevOps Engineer<p>* Backend Engineer<p>* Front-end Engineer<p>Here are some key stats about our technology and scale.<p><pre><code>    - we have over 150k monthly active users.
    - 6700+ API clients. Most popular: Feedly, IFTTT, Pocket, Zapier
    - we release changes several times a day
    - we have an entirely data-driven process, with Einstein and Buffer-Metrics, our custom built a_#x2F;b testing and metrics tracking framework.
    - Some of the tech we work with: PHP, Python, MongoDB, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk_#x2F;Auto scaling, Elasticache, SQS), Backbone.js, Grunt.js, Android, iOS.</code></pre>
More stats and stack insights here: <a href="http://overflow.bufferapp.com/2013/08/01/scaling-buffer-in-2013/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;overflow.bufferapp.com_#x2F;2013_#x2F;08_#x2F;01_#x2F;scaling-buffer-in-2...</a><p>We_#x27;re a small team of driven hackers and happiness heroes (our support people). Just like you, we_#x27;re excited and passionate about engineering challenges and have some interesting architecture and scaling problems we work on.<p>If you_#x27;re interested in coming on board, you will:<p><pre><code>    - work closely myself on technical architecture and Joel on product.
    - ship to hundreds of thousands of people who use Buffer and iterate quickly
    - work with our metrics team to make smart changes
    - be friendly and comfortable talking directly to customers on issues and features
    - be a happy, positive-minded and kind person who has a great approach in dealing with others
    - be a Buffer user 
    - be anywhere in the world, and if you_#x27;d like, you_#x27;ll have help and support from us to move to where you want to be
    - have experience working with another startup or building side projects before (would be awesome, it’s cool if not)
</code></pre>
Some aspects of Buffer culture that makes us a little different:<p><pre><code>    - we are entirely transparent. We raised $450k, we currently have 1 million users and generate $175k_#x2F;mo. Ask me anything else!
    - within the company, all salaries and equity are open and we have a formula for the distribution.
    - we_#x27;re all very focused on self improvement - we have daily standups where we discuss our current improvements. This could be waking up earlier, starting public speaking, blogging, exercise, learning a language, etc.
    - here_#x27;s our culture deck: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.slideshare.net_#x2F;bufferapp_#x2F;buffer-culture-03
</code></pre>
Salary: 88k-110k depending on location (living costs) and experience. (<a href="http://99u.com/articles/15527/the-age-of-salary-transparency" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;99u.com_#x2F;articles_#x2F;15527_#x2F;the-age-of-salary-transparency</a>)<p>Equity: 0.5-1%<p>If this sounds fun, let_#x27;s chat.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>SpaceX - Los Angeles, CA
<a href="http://www.spacex.com/careers" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.spacex.com_#x2F;careers</a><p>We seek to accelerate the course of human history by developing the technologies necessary for multi-planetary civilization.<p>We build rockets and spacecraft from the ground up, utilizing much of our own electronics, software, vehicle structures, and engine systems. The Falcon launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft are among the most ambitious engineering systems in the world. Dragon holds the distinction of being the first commercially developed spacecraft to have achieved orbit, rendezvous with the International Space Station, and a safe return to Earth. SpaceX is advancing the state of the art in a field previously dominated by nation states.<p>Our next developments include a heavy lift launch vehicle, human transportation, and a reusable launch system that will drastically reduce the cost of access to space.<p>FLIGHT SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
As a software developer on the flight software team, you will be creating software that is used to design, develop, launch and operate SpaceX flight systems. You will engage with other SpaceX engineers to discover the needs of the mission and code highly reliable software that turns the mission into a reality. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to operation during a mission. You will accept a large degree of personal responsibility, work on awesome stuff and every day be completely baffled as to how you ever worked anywhere else.<p>SPACEX SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
The flight software team is responsible for the software that runs on-board SpaceX rockets and spacecraft, but we do more than embedded software engineering: we also do simulations, distributed data management, and analysis tools used in preparation for a launch. Our problem domains span embedded, fault tolerant, flight control, web, mobile, cloud, and big data computing. The products that we develop run on low-power space computing platforms, mobile devices, desktop systems, and in data centers.<p>We are an organizationally flat group of a few dozen software engineers. Although we work on and support critical systems, you wouldn’t know it from observing our office. When it comes to the code we are unrelentingly meticulous and thorough, but when it comes to people we are big on open communication, flexible hours and a casual work environment.<p>When considering you as a candidate, we won’t be focused on specific experience, skills or keywords. We will be looking for evidence that you’re smart, adaptable and exceptionally productive. You will show us that you’re an accomplished programmer, capable of working in many problem domains, and that you can ship products. You’re the engineer that other engineers can count on—you’re highly technical, you attack every problem with enthusiasm, and you share the team’s passionate dedication to the mission.<p>At SpaceX, the problem domain is full of exciting challenges, and “launching” the product will be like no other product launch you’ve ever experienced!<p>Note for new or recent graduates: If you’re a new or recent graduate, show us you have some experience outside of your academic course work. Personal projects (web apps, mobile apps, electronics, etc.), or club projects (robotics clubs, programming clubs, etc.) are a strong indicator that you have an appetite to improve yourself as a professional engineer. This will go a long way with your application.<p>You can apply online or e-mail your resume to ryan.fitzpatrick@spacex.com.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michigan<p><a href="http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com_#x2F;</a><p>---------------------------------------<p>We are a small team passionate about making people_#x27;s lives better through software.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US
  
  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we don_#x27;t artificially limit ourselves.
    In the past few months, I_#x27;ve worked with Objective-C, Backbone.js (inside 
    PhoneGap), Angular.js, Ruby (of course) and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and _gt; 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.
  
  - We_#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health_#x2F;vision_#x2F;dental insurance, quarterly profit 
    sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
    with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago and Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;beeradvocate.com_#x2F;beerfly_#x2F;city_#x2F;43
  
  - If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the Bay Area or NYC,
    you can afford a house here. I bought a nice house with a mortgage payment
    30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing technology and startup community.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.
  
  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.
</code></pre>

We_#x27;re also looking to hire someone full-time (40ish hours per week). If this sounds interesting let me know (ragalie@verbasoftware.com)<p>=========<p>About us:
The college textbook market is currently being disrupted. Verba helps colleges and universities transform themselves so that they a) embrace the power of transparency and the internet, b) become agents of change in the textbook industry instead of agents of reaction and c) continue to make approximately the same profit margin from course material sales.<p>About 300 colleges and universities use our applications to acquire low-cost inventory and price textbooks competitively. Then millions of students visit our white-labeled sites to transparently compare the bookstore_#x27;s offers against online competitors, and around 80% of students choose to buy from their local bookstore.<p>We_#x27;re looking for people familiar with some of Ruby, Rails, Clojure, MySQL and JS who can help us grow faster. We have a great team, embrace new technologies (we just switched to Puma, we_#x27;re moving to the JVM so we can use Netflix_#x27;s Hystrix project to reduce API-related downtime), but also care a lot about producing and maintaining a stable, solid product for our customers.<p>The ideal person has strong Rails knowledge, solid testing practices, a good head for architecture and knows enough JS to help out on front-end. Additional pluses are a stats background, experience with Hadoop and knowledge of scheduling algorithms.<p>You can check out our website (<a href="http://www.verbasoftware.com" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.verbasoftware.com</a>) to read about our current products and hear people say nice things about us. :)</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6477194_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6478256 href="vote?for=6478256_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6478256></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=perplexes">perplexes</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6478256">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;re an edtech startup with funding some of the biggest names in the valley (Jeff Clavier, Ron Conway, General Catalyst, Mitch Kapor...), and we_#x27;re one of the fastest growing education companies of all time. We_#x27;re the only non-YC company that Paul Graham has ever invested in. We_#x27;ve built a product that makes a real difference and gets huge engagement with millions of kids, and we_#x27;re about to take it to the next level, hopefully with you on board. We have a strong team, an extremely comfortable and relaxed environment and great salary + benefits.

--------------------<p>What_#x27;s the role?<p>--------------------<p>At the core of ClassDojo is a node.JSON API built on node.js which makes use of multiple services and handles hundreds of requests per second. The frontend web application talks to this API, and it_#x27;s a single page app that uses our own (soon to be open-sourced) JS framework - mojo.js - which combines the best bits of Backbone, Ember and Angular. That means great templating with powerful and efficient data-binding, but plenty of flexibility to build apps quickly. You_#x27;ll work on this and other awesome tools, and you_#x27;ll build a lot of user-facing features that go out to millions of kids around the world every day. It_#x27;s pretty rare to have impact like this, and as much freedom as we_#x27;ll give you.

We_#x27;d like you to be really strong on JavaScript fundamentals, up-to-date with modern JS engineering, and familiar with advanced DOM manipulation.<p>* Having said that, some minimal design chops would be cool...<p>* ...but not essential. We do have designers.<p>* A good sense of product and a desire to have a creative role in designing product features is important to us.<p>* You love building things well and building them quickly - like us!<p>The best way to show this off is to point to things you_#x27;ve built.

<a href="https://segment.io/jobs" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;segment.io_#x2F;jobs</a><p>---<p>Backend Engineer<p>Our analytics backend is getting to be quite the beast. We want your help scaling our thousands of events per second and terabytes of data. If you_#x27;re a fan of distributed systems and like to stress-test a new database every other week, you_#x27;ll fit right in. And it won_#x27;t hurt if you like streams, trying out ES6 features, and open-sourcing your work.<p>Our entire backend runs on Node, with a sprinkling of Redis, Mongo, and RabbitMQ. We_#x27;re open to running a variety of languages and could still use someone to show our Go and Erlang libraries some love.<p>Think that might tickle your fancy? We_#x27;ve got a few projects in the pipeline that you can sink your teeth into right away:<p>Live Debugger
You_#x27;ll build a system that helps developers debug requests to the Segment.io API, and whether the request has been successfully routed to all its destinations. The fun part of this one is working at a variety of scale (isn_#x27;t it always?). You_#x27;ll have to build a system which helps devs debug on localhost, but also help them monitor production environments sending 500 requests a second.<p>MapReduce for All
We_#x27;d love to have a way for developers to query the terabytes of analytics data stored in the Segment.io data warehouse. Can you streamline the process until your mother can submit mapreduce queries with ease?<p>Data Export APIs
Perhaps you_#x27;d like to build an API to export analytics data from Amazon S3 (or maybe even Glacier?). Exporting will have to stream terabytes of data without waking our ops guys in the middle of the night. Then, you_#x27;ll deploy the system to EC2 and test it, and announce it to the world!<p>To apply, email us at jobs+backend@segment.io with:<p><pre><code>  - a description of your own favorite software project (code is a bonus)
  - a link to your Github (if you have one)
  - what languages and frameworks you like to use, and why
  - any bash command you_#x27;d probably use to inspect a logfile

</code></pre>
-----<p>Mobile Engineer<p>With our new iOS and Android SDKs we want to change the mobile analytics game. The market is flooded with new mobile analytics startups, but underneath they all collect the same data. And anytime you make an analytics change, you have to re-submit your app to the app store. Bummer. :_#x27;(<p>Developers can drop in our SDK and then later enable any of Segment.io’s dozens of analytics integrations without writing additional code or even submitting updates to the app store. Both iOS and Android SDKs are open source, so you_#x27;ll be working closely with the rest of the community (and get a great chance to show off your work).<p>Here_#x27;s some examples of what you_#x27;d probably tackle at Segment.io:<p>Best New Tools
As the maintainer of the SDKs, you_#x27;d have total control over which analytics tools get added and distributed across millions of devices. What are the best new tools? Something for an interesting new app category? Help our users find the best-in-breed mobile analytics tools, and build them into the SDKs so that they can enable them instantly.<p>Community Distribution
As Segment.io_#x27;s mobile expert, you_#x27;ll be guiding (and helping write!) lots of the mobile content marketing we produce. We want you to become the world_#x27;s leading expert on mobile analytics, knowing the business models, industry, tools and problems inside and out. We_#x27;ll help propel you to become a thought leader in a brand new field.<p>Xbox, Playstation, Roku
You could also play around on new platforms, bringing analytics bliss to the home entertainment world and gaming platforms.<p>To apply, email us at jobs+mobile@segment.io with:<p><pre><code>  - a description of an app you worked on (code is a bonus)
  - a link to your Github if you have one
  - the most interesting mobile SDK you_#x27;ve worked with and why

</code></pre>
-----<p>Customer Engineer<p>At Segment.io, customer support drives the focus of the entire team. We_#x27;re looking for a hungry engineer (don_#x27;t worry, we_#x27;ll feed you) who approaches customer support with an analytical efficiency. You_#x27;ll keep finding new ways to improve the product, libraries, and docs wherever it_#x27;s needed. For most of our users, you_#x27;ll be the face of the company. Are you suave, courteous, and patient? :)<p>You_#x27;ll be responsible for analyzing our richest source of data: support requests. _quot;Where is support coming from? Why do customers need help? Which parts of the product need the most love?_quot; You_#x27;ll be in charge of automating as much of that as possible without sacrificing quality.<p>Currently we get about 40 support requests per day. Here_#x27;s the breakdown:<p>35% are variations of _quot;thanks your product is super awesome!_quot; which are fun.
25% are technical support requests for our main javascript library. You might have to jump on Skype with a Ukrainian developer or a Japanese designer (watch the timezone!) or maybe run down the street to help a local startup.
15% are technical problems with our mobile libraries for iOS and Android.
10% require debugging a server-side integration: Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, .NET, or Node.
5% are completely confused, but we still _lt;3 them.
and the remaining 10% are hiring, sales and other random inquiries.
This kind of analysis should feel natural to you!<p>Your analysis of support issues, feature requests, and customer feedback will be absolutely critical to planning tasks with the rest of the team. We want to make sure we_#x27;re all building things that will benefit our customers.<p>Segment.io_#x27;s support team also educates our customers on how the product works. You_#x27;ll chat with marketers, data scientists, developers, and business owners from all over the world to help make their analytics amazing.<p>To apply, email us at jobs+customer@segment.io with:<p><pre><code>  - a description of your own favorite software project (code is a bonus)

Since our launch, we_#x27;ve seen tremendously positive response from both press and users.<p>We_#x27;ve also built some pretty breakthrough web technologies ( <a href="http://asana.com/luna" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;asana.com_#x2F;luna</a> ), assembled a best-of-the-best engineering team (including creators of Facebook_#x27;s News Feed backend, Android_#x27;s sync, Yelp_#x27;s ranking algorithm, Aptana_#x27;s VP Eng, ...), raised $38M in funding (from Benchmark Capital, Marc Andreessen, Peter Thiel, Mitch Kapor, and Sean Parker), built a mature egoless culture, and perhaps most importantly, are earnestly pursuing a vision and opportunity that we believe has great potential for large positive world impact.<p>See what it_#x27;s like to work at Asana here: <a href="http://qr.ae/IQgg6" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;qr.ae_#x2F;IQgg6</a> and more info on our jobs page: <a href="http://asana.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;asana.com_#x2F;jobs</a><p>Interested?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Dropmysite is an internet company based in small and sunny Singapore. We want to back up The Internet and we need your help to do so. We have 2 web properties which is Dropmysite.com and Dropmyemail.com.<p>Our engineering team is expanding. We are looking for two polyglot programmers to join us. As our job title suggests, you will come across many technologies at Dropmysite. Our core code base is written in Ruby(Rails _amp; Padrino), Node.js and Scala. We have smaller projects in a variety of technologies including Python, PHP, R, etc. We also have mobile projects which are soon to be launched. Be it front-end, back-end, or rear-end, you will have plenty of opportunities to work on them.<p>We aren_#x27;t yet-another-webapp. If you want to learn data mining and data visualization, we are doing that. Our backup system is written in Scala with Akka actors. If you are interested in the business side of things, we happen to have the best in-house SEO-SEM team in Singapore. There are plenty of challenging problems to solve.<p>Like everybody, we write tests, manage our configuration with Ansible, do continuous integration with Jenkins. And we take security seriously.<p>Our engineering team composes of:
- Several Vimers, two Sublime Texters and one Emacs user.
- Two standing deskers, and many sitting deskers.
- Android rooters and no iOS fanboys.
- One Thinkpad and others all Macs<p>Join us and add to that variety.<p>We are based in Singapore, the tech capital of South East Asia. That police state with negligible taxes, crazy expensive cars, and cosmopolitan city state. The weather here alternates between Hot-And-Humid or Rainy-And-Humid. It is never cold. People come in shorts. We are located in the startup hub of Singapore: BLK 71. Developer meetups happen upstairs. There are no strict working hours. You can work at home, in shorts, no shorts, we don_#x27;t care as long as you ship.<p>If you are interested, please contact me at zan@dropmysite.com</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6475937_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6475989 href="vote?for=6475989_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6475989></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jacques_chester">jacques_chester</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6475989">link</a></span></div><br>

Factual’s location platform enriches mobile location signals with definitive global data, enabling personalized and contextually relevant mobile experiences. Built from billions of inputs, the data is constantly updated by Factual’s real-time data stack. We were recently named one of _quot;50 Disruptive Companies in 2013_quot; by MIT Technology Review. We have a terrific team that is still fairly small and an incredible CEO who was previously the co-founder of Applied Semantics (which was bought by Google and became AdSense). Factual has venture funding from Andreessen-Horowitz and our partners_#x2F;customers include Facebook, Yelp, Trulia, and Newsweek.<p>There are many challenging problems to work on at all layers of the stack: data cleaning and canonicalization, storage, deduping, serving, APIs, improving data using machine learning, etc. A great example is one of our most recent products, Geopulse Audience, which stands at the intersection of high quality places data and large scale analysis of user geo-data: <a href="http://www.factual.com/products/geopulse-audience" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.factual.com_#x2F;products_#x2F;geopulse-audience</a> .
If you love data, Factual is the place to be. Our main criteria are that you_#x27;re smart and get things done, but you_#x27;ll get bonus points for experience with Clojure (<a href="http://www.factual.com/jobs/clojure" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.factual.com_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;clojure</a>), machine learning, NLP, algorithm design, or Hadoop.<p>You can email me personally at jake@factual.com, or view our job postings and apply directly via Jobvite:<p>Los Angeles_#x2F;SF Bay Area Software engineer: <a href="http://hire.jobvite.com/j/?cj=oQR1Vfwn_amp;s=Hackernews" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;hire.jobvite.com_#x2F;j_#x2F;?cj=oQR1Vfwn_amp;s=Hackernews</a></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6477874_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6476237 href="vote?for=6476237_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6476237></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sgrove">sgrove</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6476237">link</a></span></div><br>

We work with dozens of API_#x27;s to show our users profiles of their customers without having to jump out of the email flow - imagine having <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtzqRSlgqkw" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.youtube.com_#x2F;watch?v=WtzqRSlgqkw</a> available when helping customers.<p>Thousands of people use it every day for hours on end, and are happy to pay for it to make sure they can continue using it. But there_#x27;s still so much polish and improvement possible.<p>We also spend time improving our tooling, and tools for other developers. As one example we_#x27;ve recently vastly improved the source-map capabilities of the ClojureScript compiler and added reified keywords to the runtime to make ClojureScript a better citizen on the web.

We_#x27;re building mobile apps, tackling scheduling and dispatch problems, and scaling a service at over 10% week-on-week growth.<p>I know _#x27;app for laundry_#x27; is a tech cliché right now, but we_#x27;re definitely encountering real demand.  The problem is real, and we_#x27;re solving it.<p>The team is very strong, with an HBS grad who grew up in a dry-cleaning family heading operations, and a Stanford GSB grad with direct consumer startup experience heading customer acquisition.  I_#x27;m Stanford CS_#x2F;EE, have built a few teams at various startups, and am just starting to build the technology and team to support this (very viable) business.<p>The tech stack is Heroku _#x2F; Python _#x2F; Django _#x2F; Phonegap _#x2F; JQuery _#x2F; Backbone _#x2F; Twilio currently, but obviously there is plenty of opportunity to influence technology decisions early on, and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies as well.  We expect the next couple of hires to own entire new efforts, and have their hands in wide-ranging parts of our entire business.<p>We_#x27;re looking for a Web Developer or Front-end Developer to develop interfaces for our customers, tools for our personnel, and visualizations for our managements.  Ideally, this person would also have an active role in the design process as well, either leading design or working with our contract designer.<p>We_#x27;re also looking for a _#x27;Special Ops Manager_#x27; - a _#x27;Swiss-Army Knife_#x27; hustler who wants to join a startup on the ground-floor.  This person will use the tools we_#x27;re developing in-house, and be involved in all facets of the business, including operations, marketing, social media, and any other aspect of the business that requires attention on any given day.

We_#x27;re the special operations team for the corporate world.<p>We_#x27;re hunting for engaging problems and opportunities to create real value for our marketing, sales, and research teams throughout our international businesses (television, movies, news, and home entertainment).<p>You_#x27;ll be helping us on a variety of problems - little ones like writing a script to hack a third party_#x27;s website and collect info on our products, to large ones like creating a model that can show our products value through time.  In all cases you_#x27;ll be working closely with the a senior engineer and either senior corporate management or a business unit in TV, film, or news.  A typical week might look like this:<p>* Meet with the head of sales for a UK TV channel, learn about a problem they_#x27;re facing trying to get an accurate value for advertisement slots.<p>* Discuss what you learned with the rest of team.  Someone suggests that a nearest-neighbors regression on data from the marketing team might help.<p>* A senior dev helps you implement the algorithm and a UI for the sales team to use it.<p>* Spend some time with the sales team to see if it_#x27;s creating any value, look for improvements.<p>What we use (We list this to tell you what we_#x27;re like, not to tell you what languages we expect to see on a CV):<p>* Racket.  We_#x27;re big fans lisp and functional programming.<p>* Bash.  We create a lot of value with small dirty hacky shell scripts, and we aren_#x27;t shy about it.<p>* Whatever gets the job done, and whatever we think might be fun to use.  Python, R, Javascript, Hadoop, EC2.  We even wrote code in Fortran once (we don_#x27;t like to talk about it.)<p>Who we_#x27;re looking for:<p>Most importantly, you should be an intelligent problem solver who wants to apply whatever programming and maths knowledge you have to real world problems. We_#x27;re not fussed about what languages are on your CV.<p>You have some familiarity with functional programming, machine learning, and linux_#x2F;bash scripting, and you_#x27;re eager for a chance to use it on real-world problems with support from other programmers.  Given the predictive modeling angle, you_#x27;re probably studying or have studied maths, stats, or even physics.<p>These are <i>two</i> assistant_#x2F;internship positions for students looking for experience while doing their degree.  Alternatively, if you can take on several projects in a full time role, please get in touch, too. We_#x27;re pretty flexible.<p>Interested?  My contact details are in my profile.  Get in touch.

Does coding in JavaScript feel better than Christmas morning? Does programming in JavaScript bring you more satisfaction than rainbows and puppies combined? Read on, you Maniac Hack.<p>If you’ve been to university, you understand the nut Top Hat is trying to crack. Your professor starts to talk, and you really do have every intention of listening. But within about five minutes, your good intentions fly out the window and you begin to surf Facebook, catch some Zz’s, or if you’re feeling really ambitious start working on a problem set for a completely unrelated class. When you join our team, you’ll be working on classroom interaction software and help higher education find its mojo!<p>Your work will touch hundreds of thousands of paying customers (300,000 and growing every day). Plus, you’ll get to ship code on a weekly basis. We only officially launched a little over two years ago, but we’re already profitable and are growing like crazy! Lucky for you, we’re small but mighty. That means you get to touch everything—front-end, back-end, database code—whatever your little hacker heart desires! And what’s more? Everything you touch will be yours. Well, kind of. We follow the “Facebook approach,” meaning we give developers complete ownership of features.<p>The Fabulous Life of the Top Hat Developer comes with other sweet perks too. Every fifth week is hack-week, where you and your fellow developers get to spend a week working on pet projects. There’s also lots of free deliciousness. What’s up catered breakfast and unlimited snacks and drinks? Oh, and did we mention StarCraft throw-downs at lunch?

Our systems are written on the LAMP stack and we are migrating to Symfony 2 as our MVC framework. Developers choose the tools that work best for them - for instance, we have a mix of Linux and Mac workstations in the team. We are adopting and adapting agile development techniques such as test-driven development, pair programming, and continuous integration. We hold regular retrospectives to improve our working environment and lightning talks to share cool ideas whether work-related or not.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Software Engineer at Aircloak - REMOTE ((UTC +2) +- 2)<p>My name is Sebastian, and I am the CTO at Aircloak. Aircloak is a young and well-funded startup working on privacy preserving data processing and analytics. We are a spinout from the German Max-Planck Institute for Software System research institute and receive a lot of backing and support from the institute and their extended network.<p>Our technology allows us to process highly private streams of data and only ever make fully anonymous data available to our customers. One of the features that make our system unique is that no one, including operators, customers, and ourselves, ever has access to the sensitive raw data. This property holds true even after we update the software running on the machines processing the sensitive data!<p>You should:<p><pre><code>    - be intelligent
    - have a good sense of humour
    - be an amazing programmer
    - wish to change the world
</code></pre>
Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.<p>The founding team consists of recent University of Cambridge graduates and a director at the Max-Planck Institute. In the past month we have also been joined by two excellent engineers.<p>The work environment is highly international and diverse, and we would like to keep it that way. We are looking to hire one additional engineer, and are in the lucky position where we can afford to be picky with whom we choose.
Our team is distributed, and we would therefore expect you to work remotely as well. We would prefer if you were located within one or two timezones of our own (UTC+2).
We offer good and stable salary, generous equity, exciting problems to solve, and a fabulous team, and in turn expect you to be driven, social, and good at solving problems.<p>We hope to hear from you. Please email us at jobs@aircloak.com if you have any questions!<p>You can find more on our website: <a href="http://www.aircloak.com/join.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.aircloak.com_#x2F;join.html</a></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6500234_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6478091 href="vote?for=6478091_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6478091></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ritikm">ritikm</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6478091">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>IFTTT - <a href="https://ifttt.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;ifttt.com_#x2F;jobs</a> - San Francisco, CA<p>==================================<p>IFTTT is looking for engineers to help build the next generation of its platform. This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 70 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We_#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.<p>==================================<p>Mobile Engineer<p>Earlier this summer we released our first mobile app, IFTTT for iPhone (<a href="https://ifttt.com/mobile" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;ifttt.com_#x2F;mobile</a>). The response has been overwhelmingly positive (Editor_#x27;s Choice, #1 Productivity). We_#x27;re looking for talented mobile developers who can help us continue to innovate on iPhone, as well as bringing IFTTT to new platforms (Android, wearable computing, embedded systems, etc).<p>==================================<p>Platform Engineer<p>We’re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we’re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6476302_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6485434 href="vote?for=6485434_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6485434></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=aubergene">aubergene</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6485434">link</a></span></div><br>

FULLTIME - Software Engineers<p>Apartment Investors are overwhelmed and unable to make effective decisions using the data generated by their apartments every day.  The status quo is full of siloed data that can only be accessed via outdated web applications which allow their users to download disjointed Excel reports.  Rentlytics changes all of this by bringing their data into one place, enabling the asset management team to make better decisions with our analysis tools.<p>Today, our software provides trend analysis tools to let users discover previously unseen spikes in their utilities, apartment refinishing costs, marketing spend, or any of the 250 other data points we track for each apartment.  We need you to come help us build tools that help our users perform complex analysis with the click of a button.<p>My co-founder Justin was a partner at a private equity firm that invested into apartments across the USA.  It is from his frustrations there that our product was born.  I built a few large social media analytics tools, mobile games, and a number of analytics tools for other industries.  Our engineering team is 3 people right now, we would like to add 2 more people by January 2014.<p>We use Python_#x2F;Django for our backend, and Coffeescript with Backbone_#x2F;Marionette for the frontend application.  Experience using these would be great, but is not required.<p>If you_#x27;re interested in changing an industry, then we should chat: phil@rentlytics.com</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6477704_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6479851 href="vote?for=6479851_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6479851></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mierle">mierle</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6479851">link</a></span></div><br>

H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything, designing and implementing our own trading strategies and infrastructure. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and want to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy and_#x2F;or on infrastructure.  No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of an infrastructure project is designing and building a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss, and such hardware has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p>Please visit <a href="http://amacapital.net/careers.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;amacapital.net_#x2F;careers.html</a> to learn more, and, if interested, apply to careers@amacapital.net.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6476331_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6477234 href="vote?for=6477234_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6477234></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=henrygarner">henrygarner</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6477234">link</a></span></div><br>

Really neat stuff.<p><pre><code>  ===========================

Intrans
Ruby Engineers, Android Engineers<p>The last 50 years has seen the reinvention of almost every major industry except for one: Trucking. Intrans is here to change that by deploying the world_#x27;s first mobile platform for on-demand freight shipping.<p>Over $30 billion dollars a month is spent trucking freight around the US. Without trucks, the country would grind to a halt overnight. In such a massive market, it_#x27;s hard to believe that the entire industry today still runs on phones and fax machines. This means hundreds of millions of dollars worth of freight capacity goes unfilled every month due to the old-school inefficiencies of the industry.<p>We are changing that. We use our location-based technology
to automatically match supply and demand.<p>If you_#x27;re ready to transform the trucking industry,

Statwing_#x27;s users demand larger data, more complex analyses, and faster interaction. We_#x27;ll need to optimize regression, graph, and dozens of other statistical algorithms to efficiently handle wildly diverse datasets. Those analyses will sit on a robust data-handling system that finishes analyses before our users even know they need them. And Statwing_#x27;s deep interaction and data exploration needs to feel like it_#x27;s happening locally even when it_#x27;s not.<p>The ideal candidate:<p>. Excited about taking responsibility and ownership over big pieces of the product<p>. Comfortable with efficiently handling and processing relatively large amounts of data.<p>. Interested in data analysis.<p>. Very comfortable with Python. Some experience with Clojure is a bonus.<p>. An extremely talented programmer, skilled in dealing with performance tradeoffs and bottlenecks.<p>. Deeply concerned with system reliability, code quality, and back end architecture.<p>. Open to asking for help, taking feedback, collaborating, and generally being a team player.<p>. Humor.

Experience with Angular would be particularly cool.<p>Check out our jobs page at <a href="https://circleci.com/jobs" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;circleci.com_#x2F;jobs</a>.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6478770_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6479511 href="vote?for=6479511_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6479511></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Alex3917">Alex3917</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6479511">link</a></span></div><br>

We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use.<p>We believe that there are jobs that a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs that a human is best at doing. We want to empower businesses everywhere to create processes and systems that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.<p>We believe that with the right tools, you can have 10X the impact with less work.<p>We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean less bureaucracy and less management and more getting things done.<p>We believe that credentials are not needed. Our head of development has a finance degree. Our head of business and marketing has an engineering degree. Our head of design has a mechanical engineering degree.

ThoughtWorks - Principal Technical Consultant<p>Our mission is to better humanity through software. We strive to achieve this by delivering disruptive thinking to companies with ambitious missions, keeping technology at the heart of what we do. As a Principal Technical Consultant, you_#x27;re responsible for creating and implementing cutting-edge technology solutions for our customers whilst driving software excellence to influence and shape the wider software industry as well as our business.<p>As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, here_#x27;s what we_#x27;ll be looking for you to bring:<p>- You love coding. Even if your recent roles have taken you away from being as hands-on as you might like, you_#x27;ve no doubt found other ways to keep your coding skills from getting too rusty and we expect that you_#x27;ll have had exposure to recent technologies. 
- You have a rich breadth of experience and are equally comfortable talking financial projections or business process modelling as you are advocating for TDD.
- You really understand the business context of the challenges that organisations face and distinguish yourself in the way you articulate this with clients to create and deliver robust, scalable, elegant, flexible and relevant software solutions that truly transform industries.
- Leadership is not something you do from far away, you get the importance of taking people with you along the journey and are able to influence and coach those around you to orchestrate team success.<p>As a Principal Consultant at ThoughtWorks, here’s what you can do:<p>- Directly guide the technical strategy for one of the world’s largest airlines. Build out a new capability within ThoughtWorks - perhaps for Mobile, Big Data or DevOps. Explore ways to improve our business relevance for customers. Create and implement an original tech solution to manage high broadcasts for a new live sports coverage. Travel and work on high impact global P3 (pillar 3) projects in locations such as Africa or Ecuador. Deliver the new technology platform for a government agency providing tailored information to the public_#x27;s needs. Speak at conferences. Influence and shape our client portfolio. Get published.<p>There_#x27;s no typical day or engagement for our Principal Consultants. You might spend a few weeks with a new client on a deep technical review or a complete organisational review, helping them to understand the potential that technology has to solve their most pressing problems. On other projects, you might be acting as the architect, leading the design of technical solutions, or perhaps overseeing a programme inception to build a new product. It could be much more about getting stuck into a delivery project where you_#x27;re equally happy coding and tech leading the team to implement the solution. Whatever your role the team always look to draw on your experience when things get tough and you often handle the difficult client conversations allowing the team to continue building software without undue pressure. You have great relationships with our new business team and work collaboratively to support pre-sales, meet prospective clients and ultimately influence and shape our portfolio of work.<p>You recognise that building your network is absolutely key to enable you to perform in your role - and you appreciate that it might be tough initially to find your place in our incredibly flat-structured organisation. You_#x27;ll be drawing on all of your passion for technology, recent hands-on coding experience and knowledge of latest tech and industry best practices to help you gain the respect and credibility of your fellow technologists.<p>About ThoughtWorks<p>ThoughtWorks is a software company and community of passionate individuals whose purpose is to revolutionize software design, creation and delivery, while advocating for positive social change. Our clients are people and organizations with ambitious missions; we deliver disruptive thinking and technology to empower them to succeed. In our 20th year, over 2300 ThoughtWorks employees - _#x27;ThoughtWorkers_#x27; - are currently serving clients from offices in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Singapore, South Africa, Uganda, Ecuador the U.K., and the U.S.<p>To apply (or to look at other global opportunities) please visit <a href="http://join.thoughtworks.com/apply" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;join.thoughtworks.com_#x2F;apply</a></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6476546_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6476590 href="vote?for=6476590_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6476590></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=alexdevkar">alexdevkar</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6476590">link</a></span></div><br>

  * we’re well funded (we just raised a $2M seed round) and have had paying clients since day 1 of the company 

  * we’re hiring designers and all types of devs -- mobile, frontend, backend, analytics 

  * we think even enterprise software can be beautiful, and pride ourselves on our design 

  * every single one of our developers have committed code within their first day at work; some within their first hour
</code></pre>
Here’s some stuff we’ve been working on lately:
  * building infrastructure to allow us to scale our video recording and streaming<p><pre><code>  * re-building the UI-heavy sections of our product using AngularJS 

  * designing and creating our mobile suite for both job candidates and employers alike 

  * presenting analytics data captured in our product to the end user, and our team internally
</code></pre>
We use Python_#x2F;Django, JavaScript (jQuery, AngularJS), ActionScript, MySQL (and some MongoDB), but you’d be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>If this sounds fun, let’s chat!

On Tuesdays we have a 1 hour product meeting over Google Hangout. We_#x27;re on IRC all the time.<p>Push Process: Push to master whenever you want, unit tests run automatically and are hooked up to IRC; push to prod whenever you want as long as unit tests pass. QA on your own. It’s OK if you break the site from time to time, we like taking risks and prefer to push code.<p>Whitetruffle job openings:<p>1.

Unlimited paid time off, flexible hours, cutting edge technology, and sweet hardware all while working in a fun environment. AccuLynx isn’t your typical startup company. For one, we’re profitable! Second, our primary product is a SaaS that caters to specialty trade contractors. Yup, software helping construction contractors. We are looking for a “smart-and-gets-things-done” senior software engineer. We don’t care if you used to work for black-market hamster traffickers or moonlighted as a garden gnome. We do not hire based on buzzwords or popular acronyms. We expect you to have mastered at least one language and be eager to master any technology or language in the future.<p>At AccuLynx, the employees are a highly valued asset and we strive to provide the best working environment possible.

ShowKit is a mobile software development kit that turbo charges apps with live communication features in under 30 minutes. Before ShowKit, it would take companies and software engineers months of intensive development to add features like audio_#x2F;video conferencing, screen sharing, and gesture control to their applications. Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users’ screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio_#x2F;video conference.<p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding _amp; decoding. This enables 720p at 30fps, the highest quality video conferencing resolution on the market, while using minimal cpu resources and allowing the app to run seamlessly in the background while a call is taking place. Comparable solutions use full cpu resources _amp; only achieve 4-5fps at that resolution, which isn’t feasible for video conferencing.<p>AngelList Profile: <a href="http://angel.co/showkit" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;angel.co_#x2F;showkit</a>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Square — NYC
<a href="https://squareup.com/" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;squareup.com_#x2F;</a>
---<p>Square! In October 2012, we acquired the design firm 80_#x2F;20 and have had New York based colleagues for some time now. Our logical next step was to bootstrap a NYC Engineering presence to tap in the growing community here. We just started building the Engineering team in July.<p>As a company, we have four main focuses.<p>Go international. We_#x27;re adapting what made us successful in the US abroad. This is harder than typical international plays since it requires translating our four major benefits to small merchants: 1. Shipping readers, 2. Card payments (physical world is much more complex than online), 3. Sending money quickly to our merchants, a.k.a. settlement: very localized and next-day is hard on a number of fronts), 4. Assessing risk of merchants as they sign up, aka underwriting: again, very localized most countries do have FICO scores, SSN, D_amp;B numbers and such.<p>Move up market. One of the biggest success of Square is to have enabled merchants who were _quot;non-consumers_quot; to start accepting credit cards. In classic disruptor fashion, we have essentially alonged the long tail. We haven_#x27;t been eating someone else_#x27;s lunch, we_#x27;ve created a whole new category! Now it_#x27;s time to move up to bigger merchants.<p>The other side of the counter. With Wallet, Square Market (<a href="http://squareup.com/market" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;squareup.com_#x2F;market</a>) and Square Cash (<a href="http://squareup.com/cash" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;squareup.com_#x2F;cash</a>), we_#x27;re going on the other side of the counter and interacting directly with consumers. We think that we can provide the best experience for consumer-to-merchant and consumer-to-consumer commerce. We_#x27;re at the infancy, but extremely well positioned to succeed.<p>Data as product. We_#x27;re leveraging our data. We know a lot about our merchants: daily sales, seasonality, growth of their business, correlation with other events (e.g. Mapping Square Payments During the Super Bowl). Lots of innovative products are in the making which will highlight the breadth of what we do.<p>In NYC, we_#x27;re starting with a focus on infrastructure, distributed systems, and money moving systems. We_#x27;re a small team, located in SoHo, and defining the culture of engineering for Square on the East Coast.<p>If you_#x27;re interested; I_#x27;d love to chat.

We are not buying eyeballs in hopes of selling them later. We are attacking massive market inefficiencies and generating extremely healthy margins. We are both riding and driving a huge change in the way IT infrastructure is bought, used and sold.<p>We_#x27;re pragmatists, not purists. We’ve bought into reality, whatever that might be, not married to our ideas. You_#x27;ll fit in best if you are as well. We’re seasoned veterans with big wins and big, educational losses under our belts. We try to use the right technology for the job, with familiarity being a tie breaker.

The test team supports all the development we do, at approximately a 2devs:1tester ratio.<p>* DBA - Our Data Team is lean and the individuals on the team wear many hats.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Seattle, WA - ExtraHop Networks - Software Engineers, Testing Engineers, Support Engineers, Sales Engineers, and more.<p>ExtraHop is a ~6 year old, fast growing startup building network appliances for application analysis. Think HTTP_#x2F;DB_#x2F;memcache_#x2F;NAS_#x2F;etc processing times for all the servers in a datacenter, all by passively watching the network.<p>I_#x27;m a software engineer at ExtraHop and here_#x27;s why I love my job:<p>1. The team is amazing and everyone makes a difference. The two founders, Jesse and Raja, designed and built BigIP v9 when they were at F5 Networks before founding ExtraHop, and are still very much involved in engineering. It_#x27;s a great working environment and we have a lot of fun.<p>2. Hard problems at all levels. We parse a bunch of different protocols at 20Gbps by writing high-performance multithreaded C and our own linux kernel drivers. Our datastore handles 200,000 inserts a second with 10MB_#x2F;s of data. Our UI has a ton of charts and tables, with data going through django and tornado. We use python, C, javascript, flex (slowly moving to a new UI with html5 + javascript), and a modified yacc+bison for some of our protocol parsers. You can hack anything from C to the front-end design and anywhere in between.<p>3. Our customers love it. It_#x27;s awesome to see problems diagnosed and solved with our box.<p>jobs@extrahop.com<p><a href="http://www.extrahop.com/company/jobs/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.extrahop.com_#x2F;company_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;</a></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6476409_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6476915 href="vote?for=6476915_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6476915></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=alexdias">alexdias</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6476915">link</a></span></div><br>

We_#x27;re a well-funded company with a small, agile development team, and our platform has handled over £365 million of bets since launching in 2010. Smarkets has been featured in publications such as Wired, The Wall Street Journal and TechCrunch and was recently selected as part of the Startups 100.<p>We_#x27;re building a reliable, low-latency exchange system to facilitate automated traded strategies, as well as a fast, modern web interface. Our team constantly works on significant, challenging software engineering problems; if you_#x27;re fed up of writing yet another boring CMS, we might be able to help. The Smarkets platform is written predominantly in Python and Erlang, and relies heavily on asynchronous programming techniques and REST. We make extensive use of version control, configuration management and automated testing, which allows us to reliably deploy code to production several times a day.<p>Our team builds on a modern, open-source software stack which includes Linux, Vagrant, Flask, Eventlet, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, ElasticSearch, Graphite, Chef and Git.<p>For more info: <a href="http://info.smarkets.com/about/jobs/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;info.smarkets.com_#x2F;about_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;</a></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6476915_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6479112 href="vote?for=6479112_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6479112></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=robalfonso">robalfonso</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6479112">link</a></span></div><br>

Bridging the gap between real estate professionals and their clients.<p>Real estate is the largest industry in the world. It’s also one of the most important—after all, everyone needs a place to live. Millions of consumers are looking for their next home online, and they expect the same kind of browsing and buying experience they get on sites like Amazon and Facebook.<p>Unfortunately, real estate agents are struggling to provide that experience. That’s where Placester comes in. We’re creating an industry where it_#x27;s quick and simple for real estate professionals to get their information on the web.<p>Don’t let that simple description fool you. We’re addressing the hardest problem in the largest industry in the world. As you might have guessed, not everything is written on the home page yet.<p>Our Culture: Team.
Join the team that makes a difference in a big, complex industry.
Our culture is all about teamwork. That being said, we_#x27;re composed of folks who are their own brand of brilliant, focused, fun, intense, and friendly. If you_#x27;ve ever worked on a high performing team you_#x27;ve experienced this mix before.<p>You’ll be expected to get things done and be responsible for making it happen, without any bureaucratical mess. You’ll be expected to identify problems and solve them on your own. But more importantly, you may need to rally a friend or team to overcome them. Both are key tools on your belt.<p>You’ll be expected to have an opinion because it will matter when shaping the outcome of your company. Opinions are about courage: to speak your mind and to change it.<p>Everyone laughs a lot over lunch. Topics range from the standard technical, tactical and whos-doing-what in the start up world; but they also weave through topics like the proper structure for the US debt, that great restaurant down the street or how to Sous-vide the perfect piece of meat. Brilliance isn’t one-dimensional.<p>There’s a local coffee shop that often serves as the perfect distance for discussing a hard problem. We deal with a lot of hard problems and really like great coffee. It’s a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem itself… which is a good reason to take a walk and discuss it over a cup.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6477983_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6479586 href="vote?for=6479586_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6479586></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mconnell">mconnell</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6479586">link</a></span></div><br>

Both, we have slated to be written in Ruby on Rails (using a yet to be determined mix of UI techniques that include but aren’t limited to jQuery, CSS3, HTML5, SASS, HAML, and possibly some UI framework such as AngularJS, Backbone, Ember, etc).<p>The reason for the other technologies is because of legacy systems we are sun-setting (.Net applications), and future technologies we have evaluated, but aren’t at the moment utilizing (Python, NodeJS, etc).<p>Ideally, a senior with a diverse background that has focused on Rails for the past few years, but is open and willing to change, and bonus points for one that is either active in the open source community (codes not only for work, but for fun) and_#x2F;or has a touch of entrepreneurial_#x2F;change-the-world spirit.<p>Full job post here: <a href="http://ourhealth.hirecentric.com/jobs/45342.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;ourhealth.hirecentric.com_#x2F;jobs_#x2F;45342.html</a></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=6482035_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6475922 href="vote?for=6475922_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%36%34%37%35%38%37%39"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2 alt="upvote"></a><span id=down_6475922></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=andrewcooke">andrewcooke</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6475922">link</a></span></div><br>
