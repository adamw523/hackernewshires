<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Codified Genomics - Houston TX (remote OK)
codifiedgenomics.com<p>Software you write at Codified will directly influence healthcare decisions for thousands of patients. We_#x27;re looking for experienced software engineers who are up to that challenge, and who have a track record of working in an environment that demands a high level of quality.<p>We do clinical genomic variant analysis. We take whole exome sequence data and predict clinical outcome for the variants we observe in patients, which is then used by clinicians to inform treatment. To do this, we aggregate large amounts of additional data on individual genes and variants, and apply a series of proprietary algorithms. We started with seed funding and are currently profitable with revenue from our first customer.<p>We_#x27;re hiring our first engineer. At Codified your responsibilities will be wide - you will probably end up touching every piece of software we write, with an emphasis on the user facing applications. We are currently using GWT and mysql with some scripting in Python. Additionally, you_#x27;ll help us grow our team over the next few months as we continue to add engineers.<p>We have a large number of interesting projects under active development, spanning natural language processing, machine learning, user interface design and of course sequence analysis.<p>We_#x27;re looking for someone who is experienced, flexible and willing to work outside of their comfort zone. A willingness to learn is more important to us than a Biology background, but the job will require you to learn the basics of the Biology that we_#x27;re working with.<p>We_#x27;re willing to consider remote work for experienced candidates, but preference will be shown to candidates in the Houston area.<p>We are offering 70k+ salary and equity.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Mutually Human - Grand Rapids, Michigan<p><a href="http://www.mutuallyhuman.com/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.mutuallyhuman.com_#x2F;</a><p>---------------------------------------<p>We are a small team of software craftsmen (10 of us right now) passionate about making people_#x27;s lives better through software.<p>A little bit about us:<p><pre><code>  - We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US
  
  - Though everyone here is fluent in Ruby, we_#x27;re more concerned with using the 
    right tool for the job. In the past two months, I_#x27;ve worked with Objective-C,
    Javascript (Backbone+PhoneGap), and a little bit of Java and C#.
  
  - We practice a sustainable pace. We recognize that we each have lives,
    activities, and families outside of work. Late nights and _gt; 40 hour weeks are
    rare by design.

  - We_#x27;re agile, but not dogmatic about it. Our process evolves to suit our needs.
  
  - We offer competitive salaries, health_#x2F;vision_#x2F;dental insurance, 401(k) + match, 
    quarterly profit sharing, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office with
    snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.
</code></pre>
A little bit about Grand Rapids:<p><pre><code>  - 2.5 hours from Chicago, 2.5 hours from Detroit, less than an hour to the beach.
  
  - Lots of great beer. Founders Brewery (a mile from our office) has 3 beers in
    the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA. 
    Just look here: http:_#x2F;_#x2F;beeradvocate.com_#x2F;beerfly_#x2F;city_#x2F;43
  
  - Affordable housing. If you’re renting anything larger than a breadbox in the 
    Bay Area or NYC, you can afford a house here (or a much nicer rental). I bought 
    a nice house with a mortgage payment drastically lower than the rent of my 
    1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
  
  - A growing economy driven by technology, healthcare, and a growing list of
    startups. The energy here around the growth in technology and the support
    for entrepreneurs is infectious.
</code></pre>
A little bit about you:<p><pre><code>  - You love writing software, and you have a few years of experience doing it.

  - You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
    afraid to use more. It would be nice if you use and love Ruby, but not required.
  
  - You believe software is written for humans, not computers.
  
  - You want to come into work every day and enjoy the people you work with.
</code></pre>
If you_#x27;re interested, send me your resume_#x2F;CV and a little bit about why you’re interested:<p>ej@mutuallyhuman.com</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5970801 href="vote?for=5970801_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%39%37%30%31%38%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5970801></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nrp">nrp</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5970801">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>San Francisco, CA. Full time.<p>Academia.edu is a social platform for academics to share research papers. The company_#x27;s mission is to accelerate the world_#x27;s research.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the world’s scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the world’s scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the world’s scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.
It_#x27;s an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day. We_#x27;re a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.
Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it_#x27;s not essential. It_#x27;s far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly. We are looking to hire a range of positions:
* full stack engineers * growth engineer (optimizing our growth and retention channels)

This would alleviate many of the problems you_#x27;ve highlighted with regards to the convenience of capturing the data. Video capture would be the main focus of the person we hire.<p>We_#x27;re also keen to point out we_#x27;re not a diagnosis service, nobody but a trained medical professional can tell you whether or not you have a melanoma.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Union Square, San Francisco, CA. Full-time. Full-stack Engineer, All Levels.<p>Red Hot Labs (RHL) is looking for full-stack engineers at all levels that want to work on cutting edge mobile games and services for other mobile developers.<p>=Responsibilities=<p><pre><code>    - Write both server and client-side mobile code for iOS and Android apps. 
      (We can teach you this!)
    - Actively learn and work with new technologies. There’s a very good chance 
       you’ll pick up experience with a new language _#x2F; technology stack here!
    - Collaborate closely with myself and the rest of our team to develop 
      products and services with a high quality user-experience. 
    - Architect and own big parts of our infrastructure. 

</code></pre>
=Your skills=<p><pre><code>    - REQUIRED: CS degree or significant experience in a low-level language (C, C++). 
         - We_#x27;re trying to hire smart folks that have a solid CS foundation.
    - REQUIRED: Prior experience working with Javascript required.
    - REQUIRED: Ability to pick up new languages and frameworks quickly.
    - PREFERRED: Prior experience developing either business intelligence or games.
    - PREFERRED: Prior mobile experience in either iOS or Android.

</code></pre>
=Why Red Hot Labs=<p>We’re a small 6-person FUNDED startup founded by the guys who made FarmVille and CityVille. We’re building mobile games and supporting services that we think are missing from the mobile ecosystem. This is not our first startup; our last one was acquired by Zynga and led to them being able to IPO using our core-tech and games.<p>Our company culture is one built on learning and the belief that everyone is a student and everyone is a teacher. We want to work with folks that inspire us to learn more and do our best work. We invest in our employees and want to help you grow in both your core skill-set and other areas you may be interested in. We can afford to do this while we’re small.<p>We focus on shipping quickly and constantly (our first game was built in 6 weeks with no pre-existing client-side code), so this is a great place to experience shipping multiple products. Our product development process is a full-team collaborative one based on a healthy balance of metrics and design intuition. We care A LOT about good design and are always striving for putting out products we’re proud of both technically and visually.<p>Our tech-stack is built on accelerating the ability to ship. We’ve developed a unique client_#x2F;server architecture that we use for all of our apps that allows us to write new backend connected mobile apps without having to write modify any server code. This backend combined with our unique embedded-JS frontend allows us to deploy fully featured cross-platform apps very quickly. Our first-game was featured on Google Play and was built in about 6 weeks.<p>=Perks=<p><pre><code>    - WORKCATIONS! We’re a small company so we do unscalable things such as 
      rent a house for the whole team and spend a week working from a Ski-house Tahoe 
      or in a beach-house in Hawaii. 
    - Early-stage startup equity grants
    - Health_#x2F;Dental_#x2F;Vision insurance
 
</code></pre>
=Our stack=<p><pre><code>    - An advanced client-side architecture written in C++ and 
      using embedded-JS bound to Objective-C_#x2F;Java for our iOS and Android apps.
    - Redis, Couchbase, Rails for our backend API.
    - Mostly AWS with a little bit of Heroku for our hosting.
    - AngularJS, jQuery, Underscore for our dashboard and web apps.
    - 3rd party services: Twilio, Mailgun, Mixpanel, Crittercism, Testflight

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>We Are Pop Up - London, UK - Web Application Developer (full-time)<p>We Are Pop Up is a community-driven marketplace for short-term commercial property leasing. While we certainly didn_#x27;t invent the concept of a _quot;pop up shop_quot;, we_#x27;re embracing it whole-heartedly as a solution to two social problems which have arisen in our  time: 1) How can we lower the barrier-to-entry to enable a new generation of retail, food, and creative entrepreneurs to operate as easily in the offline world as businesses currently do online? 2) As commerce increasingly moves online, vacant property is left behind, which can have detrimental effects on both the nearby businesses and the greater community alike. How can we find new ways of filling that space? The missing piece which transforms these two real problems into mutual solutions is an excellent software platform that removes the time and overhead typically associated with commercial leasing. We Are Pop Up officially launched this platform near the end of 2012, and has already given numerous creative entrepreneurs around the UK opportunities to engage the offline world in ways they never had before.<p>We_#x27;re looking for an experienced Web Application Developer to work directly along side our Lead Developer and Creative Director, building features and scaling the platform. Someone who_#x27;s comfortable working with the whole stack, understands the principles of excellent software development, and wants to treat their code as their craft. We_#x27;re primarily in a Django_#x2F;Python environment, but any relevant experience is great, as long as you are willing to learn Python. The number of years you_#x27;ve been working professionally isn_#x27;t too important (though it should be at least _quot;a few_quot;), but what you_#x27;ve done is. Being an expert in SQL will get you a lot of points. We follow Agile development practices, and you_#x27;ll be shipping features frequently.<p>--<p>Skills and Attributes We_#x27;re Looking For (being 100% in all is not required, but candidates who are will receive preference)<p>* Experience building web applications from the bottom, up.

We use Postgres, but are happy with MySQL or similar experience<p>* Ability to work in Javascript_#x2F;HTML_#x2F;CSS. We use YUI 3 and Bootstrap. You certainly don_#x27;t need to be a designer, but you should be able to take on a feature and fully implement it, including all relevant front-end code<p>* General understanding of Solr_#x2F;Lucene search<p>* Experience deploying basic server infrastructure and with the Unix command line (being an expert SysAdmin is not required)<p>* Familiarity with code profiling and optimization<p>* Interested in things like Agile development, TDD, and pair-programming<p>* Work equally well in close coordination with others and independently_#x2F;self-directed. We_#x27;re a small team, so we_#x27;ll always be working closely, sometimes in pairs, but often you_#x27;ll need to be able to take on things on your own<p>* Legally eligible to work in the UK (mandatory)<p>What We_#x27;re Offering<p>* Competitive salary, based on experience<p>* Meaningful, early-employee equity<p>* Regularly attend some of the coolest pop-up events and parties in London<p>* Work on a developer-driven software team, where your contributions will have a hugely positive impact on the lives of others<p>More About Us<p>We_#x27;re a group of Brits and Americans who came together in the spring of 2012 to take on an ambitious idea cooked up by 2 of our co-founders in a pub one evening (where all good ideas start).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Kaiserslautern Germany, Software Engineer at Aircloak - REMOTE<p>My name is Sebastian, and I am the CTO at Aircloak.
Aircloak is a young and well-funded startup working on privacy preserving data processing and analytics. 
We are a spinout from the German Max-Planck Institute for Software System research institute, where we also currently have our offices.<p>Our technology allows us to process highly private streams of data and only ever make fully anonymous data available to our customers. 
One of the features that make our system unique is that no one, including operators, customers, and ourselves, ever has access to the sensitive raw data. This property holds true even after we update the software running on the machines processing the sensitive data!<p>You should:<p><pre><code>    - be intelligent
    - have a good sense of humour
    - be an amazing programmer
    - wish to change the world
</code></pre>
Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.<p>We are:<p><pre><code>    - recent University of Cambridge graduates 
    - one director at the Max-Planck Institute
</code></pre>
The work environment is highly international and diverse, and we would like to keep it that way.
We are looking to hire two more full time engineers. You can either work on site with us in our offices in Kaiserslautern, Germany, or, for the right candidate, remote. We offer good and stable salary, generous equity and great facilities.<p>We hope to hear from you. Please email us at jobs@aircloak.com if you have any questions!<p>You can find more on our website: <a href="http://www.aircloak.com/join.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.aircloak.com_#x2F;join.html</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5971615 href="vote?for=5971615_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%39%37%30%31%38%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5971615></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dmarble">dmarble</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5971615">link</a></span></div><br>

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We’re hoping to find candidates who speak fluently about distributed architectures, databases, and ops, who enjoy rolling up their sleeves and writing code at all levels of the stack, and who have the confidence and depth of knowledge to take ownership of long-term projects. IFTTT currently runs on a polyglot mix of technologies, including EC2, Rails, Node.js, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and Chef. Experience with these is a big plus, but we’re constantly evolving, and we value creative problem-solving and desire to learn over domain knowledge.<p>We recently secured a new round of funding, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5971476 href="vote?for=5971476_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%39%37%30%31%38%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5971476></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=lhnz">lhnz</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5971476">link</a></span></div><br>

You_#x27;ll be comfortable with canvas, SVG and graphical JavaScript libraries such as D3.js (and may have dabbled with WebGL). You_#x27;ll be familiar with PHP and have experience with front end development for dynamic content_#x2F;apps, using JavaScript libraries like Backbone.js, AngularJS or Ember.js.<p>Visualising Data. You_#x27;ll have a keen interest in visualising datasets, with a good understanding of what makes information beautiful. You_#x27;ll know that an infographic is only as good as the moment it was created. Turning great designs into live visualisations showing real data will be something that excites you.<p>Open all hours. You_#x27;ll have a keen interest in the way openness in technology (and in particular open data) can change things. And you_#x27;ll have ideas that mash one set with another, whether you_#x27;ve realised them yet or not. Our developers come up with projects for our clients, rarely the other way round.<p>More details: <a href="http://www.wearebase.com/BaseJobSpecificationMidWeightFront-endDev.pdf" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.wearebase.com_#x2F;BaseJobSpecificationMidWeightFront-...</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5970294 href="vote?for=5970294_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%39%37%30%31%38%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5970294></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=robg">robg</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5970294">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Perfect Audience - SF, CA - Dev Ops<p>About the Position:
One of the most important roles in the build-out and maintenance of this system to fill is the dev-ops _#x2F; automation engineer role. We need someone to help us assemble the airplane as it is taking off, so we need a strongly independent candidate that understands teamwork and compromise. You_#x27;ll have a lot of autonomy in this role, and will be making big choices on a rapidly scaling application. Don_#x27;t read this as you will not be supported, quite the opposite. Read this as we value your opinion and work and expect you to be deeply integrated within our team. We need to be able to depend on you, and you need to be able to depend on us.<p>What we are looking for:<p>- Our concurrent code is built in Java and handles thousands of requests a second, 24_#x2F;7. We need help keeping it happy and behaving well from deployment, to scaling to everyday operations.<p>- We run on a variety of Amazon Web Services like DynamoDB, EC2 and SQS - we need to get the most out of it. Prior experience here is a huge plus.<p>- Our code handles thousands of dollars worth of transactions a day, and is up 24_#x2F;7 so we need to monitor everything. We like Scout, Nagios and Graphite. If you have strong feelings about why these are the wrong tools, we would love to hear that too.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5971616 href="vote?for=5971616_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%39%37%30%31%38%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5971616></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=suitabletech">suitabletech</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5971616">link</a></span></div><br>

This is because my wife and I are both serial expats and we believe that people should be able to live anywhere in the world they want (we_#x27;re not saying it_#x27;s practical, but it_#x27;s still our dream).<p>Thus, since we have a lot of background in this area, I_#x27;m moderately well-known in the IT world and I keep getting companies contacting me to help them find people (because of my _quot;how to become an expat_quot; blog <a href="http://www.overseas-exile.com/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.overseas-exile.com_#x2F;</a>), we decided that we_#x27;d create a company to help people live their dreams.<p>We_#x27;re proud of the fact that we help people move to other countries.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>@Curtis (Ovid) Poe: I am not going to make an ad hominem retort directed at you as I am aware of your contribution to Perl and also that you are legally bound by Booking.com not to speak ill about them.<p>All that I am saying is, there are a lot of ways of making money and it isn_#x27;t correct to put your reputation at stake to advertise a tainted company such as Booking.com for a couple of thousand euros.<p>The frequent advertisement for developers is not only due to the exodus of senior devs (including you) from the company but also because booking is trying to create a redundant pool of devs so that the business doesn_#x27;t get effected by this employee churn.<p>If an employee complains he_#x2F;she is asked to leave the company and all that is because they have a huge cash reserve built out of years of underpaying developers and exploiting hotels.<p>Years of copy paste has made the code unmaintainable and I am not talking about the new code Aevar and you had written for Booking::Search but Booking::Maxotel, Availability, Policy system, Search::Which, Search::When, etc.
I have never seen a company which rebukes its developers for refactoring or treat its developers like dogs except at Booking.<p>As they have a real bad reputation in the Perl community they are trying to get developers from other communities who are ignorant.<p>Booking.com not only mistreats its developers they also bully the hotels using their monopoly.<p>Successful lawsuits have been filed against the company for price fixing as can be googled.<p>Only if a dev is unemployed should he consider working for Booking.com. There are a lot of good companies and they are actively seeking employees including here in the UK.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5970392 href="vote?for=5970392_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%35%39%37%30%31%38%37"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5970392></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=frabcus">frabcus</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5970392">link</a></span></div><br>

I advise on technical aspects of possible acquisitions and partnerships.<p>I make programmers who use the platform happy by making developer APIs that are a joy to use.<p>More broadly in the company, I promote a culture of excellent and professional software practices. For example, guiding design of libraries and use of tools amongst data scientists.<p>I like giving talks and writing technical articles, to communicate what we do.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Pact Coffee - London, Full Time Lead Developer
pactcoffee.com<p>We_#x27;re opening the world of small-batch, fresh roasted and better tasting coffee to a global audience, not just those lucky enough to live in Shoreditch. Join an incredible founding team and help the world fall in love with coffee again.<p>We face a huge array of creative challenges in tying together a physical product with its digital counterpart. In doing so we’re looking for an experienced Lead Developer to help confront these as part of a great founding team. This requires a strong technical knowledge (especially in Ruby), a creative approach and the ability to work with the right languages and tools for the job. You will be joining the team to lead on all things tech, and as such, we’re looking for a generalist with Ruby experience, who will both guide and work on features and tools across both product and operations.<p>Generalist: Our stack is currently made up of Postgres, Rails, HTML, CSS (+ SASS) and JavaScript. Due to the challenges we face, this list is constantly growing and evolving, and we’re looking for a Lead Developer who’s comfortable in our current stack, but has the technical breadth and knowledge to change and move things forward as our needs develop.<p>Creative: You will help define product direction and be the voice for technology in the room. We want to re-approach classic e-commerce challenges in innovative and exciting ways. Be it applying cutting edge research to make sure people get the right coffee for their palette or experimenting with Arduinos and electronics to make sure they never run out; a strong technical background combined with an ability to think creatively are essential to us fulfilling that ambition.<p>Technical chops: You will be leading on forward thinking solutions which will likely push you into areas unknown! You’ll need to be comfortable with the stack we already use whilst also being able to pick up new skills and tools quickly in order to lead the team forward.<p>Product: You will help define our product roadmap, speak to customers and lead on the implementation of user facing features. You should feel comfortable in proposing and validating ideas before going ahead and building them out yourself or with the team. Once those features are live, you should be at home making data-based decisions about their future direction and flaws.<p>Autonomous: Though decisions are made as a team, you’ll be in charge of making sure we deliver on all things tech. As a small team, everyone needs to be comfortable working together whilst also taking individual responsibility and ownership for their area. As an e- commerce company, tech sits at our heart and as such your role is mission critical to the success of the business. You should feel comfortable with this. Ultimately as the company’s technical voice, no­one will tell you how to run things or which tools are best for the job, that’s up to you!<p>Interested?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>New York, NY - Fulltime<p>Hiring: FE Engineer _amp; Head of Marketing_#x2F;Biz-dev<p>iknow.io is a data-driven knowledge sharing community for curious people. We take raw data about Movies, Music, Sports, Economics, Politics and more and make it possible for regular people to analyze and extract useful information from it. We also enable them to browse, share and discuss the fascinating insights they discover using our tools with one another.
While there are mountains of raw data out there, only scientists and programmers can currently make any real use of it. Our mission is to make that data accessible and useful to everyone. Our team has extensive experience working with large, complex data problems and in building and nurturing online communities.<p>We are currently a team of 4 people, and are looking to add 2 more talented individuals to the mix soon.<p>1) FE Engineer: You have a great design sense and some serious engineering skills. You think the famous quote, _quot;there are only two hard things in computer science, cache invalidation and naming things_quot; is spot on. Whenever you_#x27;re browsing the web, you_#x27;re constantly noticing things that could be tweaked and improved. You_#x27;re a pragmatist who_#x27;s ok with ignoring IE6 users. You_#x27;ve built complex, popular web-based applications before. You want to join an early stage startup where you can quickly prove yourself and become the FE engineering lead.
Our FE Stack includes python (django), javascript (jquery, backbone), html and css. Deep familiarity with all of these is a big plus, but not necessarily required. Experience with mobile app development is also a plus.<p>2) Head of Marketing _amp; Business Development: You_#x27;re a natural born deal maker. When you throw a party, too many people show up. You know how to build, execute and analyze the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. Bloggers and reporters know you, and love you. You believe product design and marketing are one and the same. You_#x27;re ready to join an extremely talented product _amp; engineering team and show them that everything they thought they knew about how to really promote and grow a new site from the ground-up is wrong.<p>If you fit the bill for either of these positions, and you think what we_#x27;re working on sounds intriguing, then we_#x27;d love to hear from you at jobs@iknow.io.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>AMA Capital -- Palo Alto, CA. Full time. H1B okay.<p>AMA Capital trades billions of dollars per day in the foreign exchange markets.<p>We are all engineers, and we all do a little bit of everything. We design and implement our own trading strategies and infrastructure, down to the networking code that ties us in to financial markets. We are a very small team (I am the only employee) and are looking to add one or two engineers who will focus on strategy or on infrastructure.<p>No experience or specific knowledge of finance is required. However, you do need to be at least interested in financial markets and to be able to implement your strategies carefully in C++.<p>An example of a project that a member of our infrastructure team could work on is a system for logging to non-volatile memory. We generate large logs that cover everything from prices to transaction data. NVDIMMs are a form of RAM that survives power loss. Hardware like this has been on the horizon for a while, but it is just now becoming available to early adopters. Writes to NVDIMMs will be nearly instantaneous and immediately durable. This project will be to develop an NVDIMM-based system that simultaneously functions as a log, an IPC mechanism, and a searchable database for analysis. Making this work will involve a number of pieces: kernel drivers, CPU cache control, lock-free synchronization, a daemon to write everything back to long-term (i.e. less expensive) storage, and more. If this works well, we plan to open-source all the pieces.<p><a href="http://amacapital.net/careers.html" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;amacapital.net_#x2F;careers.html</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5971087 href="vote?for=5971087_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%50%75%50%33%66%47%4a%6a%64%38%4b%77%43%38%76%4f%53%50%4e%54%69%64"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5971087></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kevinburke">kevinburke</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5971087">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Technologists Wanted to Create New Apps for Our Cities!<p>Are you a hacker with a huge heart? Code for America is looking for developers, designers, researchers, and product managers for its 2014 Fellowship.<p>If you want to make a difference while doing what you love to do, this is your chance — build apps that help municipal governments work better.<p>Cities are under greater pressure than ever, struggling with budget cuts and outdated technology. That’s why Code for America is connecting talented technologists with municipal governments to create and implement new web apps and explore new ways of resolving local challenges.<p>During previous years fellows have tackled problems such as criminal justice in NYC, economic development in Santa Cruz, Calif., and 311 in Chicago.<p>CfA fellows come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences from high-profile positions at Google, Apple, and Microsoft to smaller startups to municipal government.<p>Why Become a CfA Fellow?
- Gov 2.0 Training. You will start with a crash course in municipal government and gain practical understanding of the vital intersection of government and technology.
- Connections. The biggest names in the tech industry and the Gov 2.0 movement will provide you with unparalleled networking, mentoring, and support.
Professional Development. You will develop lasting relationships, learn new skills and languages in a fast-paced, startup atmosphere.
- Autonomy. Working in small teams with talented individuals you’ll decide what you build and how you build it — from start to finish.
- A Labor of Love. You’ll not only accomplish a lot and make the world a better place, but you’ll have a lot of fun working with other passionate people.<p>Applications are being accepted until July 31, 2013. This is an 11-month, full-time fellowship located in San Francisco.

Are you tired of commuting to DC or Northern Virginia? Swift Software is a growing product-centered technology company seeking talented developers to join our product team in Frederick, MD. Our flagship product is JobTraQ, a task management and workflow system that offers vastly more flexibility and power than any other product in our market segment, and is significantly less expensive and easier to configure than big _quot;BPM_quot; suites like MetaStorm and Lombardi. These advantages are allowing us to disrupt both markets.<p>You will create new features in JobTraQ and enhance existing functionality. You’ll help us build advanced visual design and administration tools, augment the product_#x27;s business intelligence capabilities, improve performance and scalability, and use customer feedback to enhance all parts of the system.<p>Our team has an enjoyable and collaborative culture in a creative environment. We interact positively and openly and emphasize learning and professional development. These attributes have enabled us to produce an industry-leading product with a globally recognizable and satisfied client base. Our environment is relaxed and fun, we play everything from Total Annihilation to Alien Swarm at our game nights, and we equip everyone with new quad-core Thinkpads with SSDs and dual monitors. Our policies and benefits are family-friendly, with generous vacation time, good health insurance options, and flexible work schedules.<p>For more information about this position, see the link below.

Fulltime.<p>We_#x27;re looking for a full-stack engineer_#x2F;CTO to love the hell out of this problem. You_#x27;ll be the 4th member, and technical lead, of an incredibly talented team with a track record in insurance, startups, consumer marketing and design_#x2F;UX. We have had a successful alpha phase and are already revenue positive.<p><a href="http://knowitowl.theresumator.com/apply/" rel="nofollow">http:_#x2F;_#x2F;knowitowl.theresumator.com_#x2F;apply_#x2F;</a><p>Do you want to solve:<p>A problem with scale.  Insurance is a $2 trillion industry.  That’s 36 times larger than Google and Facebook combined. Insurers pay their aging sales force a mint to sell insurance the old-fashioned way (with paper, face-to-face). We’re going to change this.<p>A problem that’s socially important.  Nobody’s helping people figure out insurance – and that’s bad. Under-insured medical problems contribute to over half of all personal bankruptcies and home foreclosures.  We’re going to deliver social impact.<p>A problem in desperate need of a new approach. The consumer problem in insurance is deceptively simple: insurance is hard to sell because people don’t want to think about bad things like death and illness. Insurers just throw money at the problem: advertising, hefty commissions, pushy sales agents. We’re introducing a new approach.<p>We’re looking to build our team with people who understand the importance of what we’re doing and want to apply their talent and energy to solving a Big Problem. We’re searching for Davids ready to take on Goliath. Come join Virgil and the KnowItOwl team to bring the $2 trillion insurance industry into the 21st century.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5971240 href="vote?for=5971240_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%50%75%50%33%66%47%4a%6a%64%38%4b%77%43%38%76%4f%53%50%4e%54%69%64"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5971240></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=carterschonwald">carterschonwald</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5971240">link</a></span></div><br>

The number of businesses using OpenStack in general and Swift in particular grows and grows, and it includes big names that make products that are used by both your little brother and your grandmother. You’ll work on a product that makes core OpenStack technology accessible to businesses of all kinds.<p>You’ll get open-source experience in a big way. At SwiftStack, we’re committed to strong participation in the OpenStack ecosystem in general and to contribution to Swift in particular. You’ll be a contributor to one of the most important Open Source projects currently active.<p>You’ll confront interesting problems every day. Writing a system like Swift and building a software ecosystem to surround it is the road less traveled. We aren’t writing yet another glorified CMS or social app or phone game. Whether it’s figuring out better algorithms for data placement, confronting a firehose of monitoring data, or determining how to integrate most flexibly with customers’ systems, there are always new and unusual problems to solve.<p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done. Tell us in a few lines of text why you’re interested in SwiftStack, and why we’ll be interested in you. We’ll be back in touch shortly to get the conversation started.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_6035616 href="vote?for=6035616_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%50%75%50%33%66%47%4a%6a%64%38%4b%77%43%38%76%4f%53%50%4e%54%69%64"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_6035616></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=hurdleress">hurdleress</a> 24 days ago  | <a href="item?id=6035616">link</a></span></div><br>

Over the last few years, we’ve grown from a Stanford dorm room to become one of the largest clinical genome centers in the world.

We’re looking for the best and brightest software engineers — strong generalists with solid CS fundamentals and practical software engineering intuition — to help us scale up genomics to billions of users.<p>Prerequisites:<p>- BS, MS or PhD in Computer Science or equivalent experience<p>- Strong software engineering fundamentals: design, testing, version control<p>- Significant independent programming experience as demonstrated by a GitHub account, personal web page, or prior experience.<p>- We like to see experience with:<p>* Python, Django, CoffeeScript, Backbone.js, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS<p>* NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn<p>* Relational database systems, such as PostgreSQL<p>* Unix, Git, and other command line tools<p>Perks:<p>-Competitive compensation and benefits<p>-Generous equity package in a fast-growing startup<p>-Catered meals every day plus a fully stocked kitchen<p>-On-site gym access to work it off<p>-Dry cleaning and laundry service</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5970796 href="vote?for=5970796_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%50%75%50%33%66%47%4a%6a%64%38%4b%77%43%38%76%4f%53%50%4e%54%69%64"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5970796></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kmano8">kmano8</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5970796">link</a></span></div><br>

I saw the crowd and stood still like a statue. I prepared for that contest for 7 days but biggest mistake I did, I was preparing for the content in my speech but not for how I should face the crowd. That day everybody laughed. I went back, my father told me that day, Avi see when we go on stage even if we perform good or bad that crowd is not gonna kill or hurt us then why we should get scared of them. Its your voice which is controlling them. Today I am a good presenter in result of that lesson.<p>Biggest Achievement: I always considered myself as a programmer but when I first saw Interview street and its challenges I realized my true level. Improving myself as a programmer here to analyze a problem more precisely is one among my biggest achievement . I am proud that today I am more or less a programmer.<p>Regards,
Avijit</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5989983 href="vote?for=5989983_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%50%75%50%33%66%47%4a%6a%64%38%4b%77%43%38%76%4f%53%50%4e%54%69%64"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5989983></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bishu">bishu</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5989983">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Hello sir, 
I am Bishwanath Mandal ,studying in Bengal Engineering _amp; Science University, Shibpur from the department of Computer Science _amp; Technology in final year(B.Tech). 
Biggest failure : I did not take IIT JEE seriously when I should have. I don_#x27;t know if I could have cleared it , but atleast I should have tried. For me failure is not to try.
Biggest Achievement : But now I am confident about myself that given a task I will try with my full commitment.I have been selected for Summer Research Fellowship Program at IIT Delhi. I was a school topper in my class 10 examinations and currently I am in top 3 students of my Computer Science batch.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Hello sir, I am K Rohit Rao from Kharagpur, pursuing B. Tech from Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur. I am presently in final year(Computer Science and Technology). IIT JEE seems to be the heart breaker for everyone, broke my heart twice. Almost cried like a baby but I learnt a lot from it.
 I was one of the toppers in school. I secured Third rank in city in dRSHTi, an All India Aptitude Test. Though I consider myself an average programmer but i am determined to  learn. I am hardworking and love to keep my grey cells active.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5972129 href="vote?for=5972129_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%50%75%50%33%66%47%4a%6a%64%38%4b%77%43%38%76%4f%53%50%4e%54%69%64"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5972129></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=KGEEK">KGEEK</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5972129">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>London, UK - M7 Real Estate - Full Stack Web Developer<p>I am Oli the Technology partner at M7 Real Estate and I am looking for a full stack web developer to work from our London Office.  I can_#x27;t accept remote workers for this role, but you_#x27;ll be working from our 7th Floor Office in Marble Arch with awesome views of Hyde Park.<p>You will be the first dedicated developer to join the business, reporting directly to me who has been the sole developer to date.  Due to the small nature of the team I really need someone self-motivated who is keen to take on new challenges and is happy to just get stuff done to help us drive our business forward.  This is not a heavily structured development team environment and you need to be comfortable with that.<p>You need to be just as happy working with relational databases, querying them and also hand coding the standards compliant HTML _#x2F; CSS to sit on top of them.  Typical projects involve PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JQuery.  Experience of CakePHP would be brilliant, as would any C# experience but neither of these are deal breakers.  Source control is GIT and the rest of your tools are broadly up you.<p>As well as our internal systems, we also provide outsourced web development services to 3rd parties so you will get to work on a diverse range of projects.  Our core business is in the process of going through a rapid period of expansion and to support that we are starting to create a more formal dev team and you will be a pivotal part of that both in terms of how we operate day to day and who we hire as and when we need to grow.<p>M7 Real Estate is a company of 30 people, led by a partnership of 11.  Most of the partnership has worked together over 3 different businesses over the course of the last 15 years.  We are a close team that finds the right people and then hangs on to them.  We are in the process of opening offices in Glasgow, Amsterdam and Denmark and Germany is forecast for later in the year.  If this is of interest and you want to find out more about who we are and what we do, then drop me an email oli.farago@m7re.co.uk</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5970406 href="vote?for=5970406_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%54%39%53%59%73%52%57%6d%69%50%71%41%6b%43%6b%39%55%49%64%46%6d"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5970406></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=helloburin">helloburin</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5970406">link</a></span></div><br>

Lots of fun will be had.<p>If we are the right team for you, and vice versa, then you_#x27;re probably a bit like us.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>WELLO - San Francisco, CA - UX Design Lead<p>At Wello (<a href="https://www.wello.com" rel="nofollow">https:_#x2F;_#x2F;www.wello.com</a>), we are rethinking how people get fit. We are bringing the Gym to your home over live video. The fitness options today work for the highly motivated but not for the rest which is evident in the rising obesity rates in the country.<p>We want you to come help us design our user experiences. Our users are across all age groups, some who are fit and some who are wanting to be more fit. Our design challenge is to build a product that makes it really easy for users to do a workout from end-to-end by getting out of their way and wowing them with the experience.<p>We think any of our team mates should have the following traits. Hardworking, analytical and a great sense of humor. They should be serious about their work, but not take themselves too seriously. We recommend that you try our product so you can tell us how you can make us better.<p>Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We graduated from Rock Health in Spring and have some great investors who get marketplaces such as ours. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide. This also means we are lowering the cost for our customers.<p>We use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. We are a small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. We love the Netflix philosophy of context and control.<p>Contact us at jobs@wello.com or ping me at amol@wello.com with your resume.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_5972979 href="vote?for=5972979_amp;dir=up_amp;whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%54%39%53%59%73%52%57%6d%69%50%71%41%6b%43%6b%39%55%49%64%46%6d"><img src="grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_5972979></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=raybesiga">raybesiga</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=5972979">link</a></span></div><br>

  * We’re well funded and have had paying clients since day 1 of the company
  * We’re hiring designers and all types of devs -- mobile, frontend, backend
  * We think even enterprise software can be beautiful, and pride ourselves on our design.
</code></pre>
Fun Fact: Every single one of our developers has committed code within their first day at work; some within their first hour.<p>Here’s some stuff we’ve been working on lately:<p><pre><code>  * Building infrastructure to allow us to scale our video recording and streaming
  * Re-building the UI-heavy sections of our product using AngularJS
  * Designing and creating our mobile suite for both job candidates and employers alike
  * Presenting analytics data captured in our product to the end user, and our team interally
</code></pre>
We use Python_#x2F;Django, AngularJS, ActionScript, MySQL (and some MongoDB), but you’d be free to choose your own tools and libraries.<p>If this sounds fun, let’s chat!

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I generally agree with you, but I think it_#x27;s bad for the Hacker News community when people don_#x27;t get thoughtful replies, even when the decision is a _quot;no_quot;. It feels the slide away from a small technologist-centric community into the corporate way of doing things is underway.<p>[Edit: to make it clear, the social contract is different on a job board, because it takes no effort to send a resume and they probably get hundreds of unqualified, spamming applicants. I just hope that isn_#x27;t what Hacker News has become. I could be wrong, though.
